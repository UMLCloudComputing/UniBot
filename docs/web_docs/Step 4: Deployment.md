## ðŸ“¦ Deploying The Discord Bot

1. Deploy your Discord Bot by running `cdk deploy`.
2. If successful, `cdk deploy` should have this: `DiscordBotLambdaTest.ApiGatewayUrl = <Your API Gateway URL>` in the output.
3. Copy the API Gateway URL and go to your Discord Developer's Portal (discord.dev). Set this as Interactions Endpoint for your Bot.

4. If this fails, try again after a few seconds. Your lambda function needs some time to boot up.

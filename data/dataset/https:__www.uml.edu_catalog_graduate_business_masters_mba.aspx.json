This environment is characterized by rapid technological change, increased international competitiveness in manufacturing and other sectors, and a labor force which expects a higher quality of work life than did previous generations of employees. These changes directly affect the health and vitality of any region\u2019s economy.\n\nThe UMass Lowell Master of Business Administration (MBA) program is designed primarily as a part-time evening program to serve middle level working professionals and others seeking management careers in business and industry. The program is designed to prepare students to manage effectively in rapidly changing regional, national, and global competitive environments. The MBA program not only requires a thorough understanding of the traditional functional areas of business, but also provides a detailed, integrated examination of issues faced by contemporary managers.\n\nThe unifying theme of industry analysis addresses the challenges posed by global competition, such as, accelerated change and complexity of technology, globalization of markets, increasing cultural diversity of human resources, ethical concerns, changing political processes, increasing role of governments in business, evolving organizational structures, and other similar issues. With this philosophical framework as its driving force, the MBA program at the University of Massachusetts Lowell prepares graduates to become leaders in a wide variety of commercial, industrial and governmental settings.\n\nAdditionally, three elective courses allow students to tailor their program to their specific professional needs. The awarding of the MBA degree signifies that the student has developed integrative skills in problem solving and decision making and can relate these skills to all functional areas of business. The development of this expertise entails an examination and application of advanced analytical tools.\n\n## 1Entrance Requirementsrequirements\n\nApplication to the MBA program utilizes a rolling admissions policy and is open to students who have earned a 4-year baccalaureate degree. An aptitude for management decision-making and demonstrated academic ability are the most important qualifications for admissions. It is also required that applicants have an adequate mathematics background.\n\nApplicants should submit, along with their graduate school application:\n\n- an official transcript of grades from their undergraduate institution(s),\n- two letters of recommendation, (letters of recommendation from work related sources are preferred),\n- a resume, and\n- a one-page written statement of academic and career goals.\n\nStudents for whom English is not their national language must also submit an official score report for the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL).\n\nThis program no longer requires an official Graduate Management Admission Test (G.M.A.T.) score or Graduate Record Examination score (G.R.E).\n\n## 2Part-time and Full-time Studystudy\n\nMBA students may attend either full-time or part-time. On campus courses meet during the evening hours beginning at 6:30 PM. Most courses are currently also offered in an online format. Courses are offered in the fall, spring, and summer semesters. A minimum full-time course load is considered to be 9 credits. Full-time students usually complete their degree requirements in two years. Part-time students must complete their degree requirements within five years.\n\n## 3Admission to MBA Coursesadmission\n\nMBA advanced core courses are open only to Manning School of Business graduate students who are fully matriculated degree candidates.\n\n## 4Residency Requirementresidency\n\nTo be recommended for the MBA degree, students are required to complete a minimum of ten courses (30 credits) beyond the Foundations Core in the MBA program at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. Only under special circumstances, and with prior approval, are students permitted to complete courses at other institutions.\n\nThe courses in the Manning School of Business are currently offered in an accelerated 8-week format. Student are allowed to register for a maximum of two courses (6 credits) per 8 week term.\u00a0In order to petition to take more than two courses per 8-week term, the student needs to submit a graduate academic petition to the Manning School Graduate Office.\n\n5Curriculum Requirementscurriculum\n\nThe MBA program consists of twelve credit hours of foundation core courses which may be waived through previous undergraduate work, and thirty credit hours (10 courses) of advanced courses and electives, for a total of 42 credit hours.\n\n## Guidelines for Graduate Equivalency Credit of Foundation Core Courses:\n\nThe maximum number of courses that can be given equivalency credit is 12 credits. A student accepted to the UMass Lowell MBA program may request equivalency credit for any of the core courses listed above. These courses may be credited with exemption (meaning a replacement course is not required) if the equivalent undergraduate course work was completed with a grade of \"B\" or better within the past ten years. Additionally, up to two courses for 6 credits can be transferred in from an AACSB-accredited MBA program\n\n## Degree Pathways for theOPTIONSOptions\n\nStudents may choose General Business or concentrate in a particular field by taking three electives in a given area. To take electives, students must have completed the foundation core and be matriculated.\n\nDegree Pathways for Options:\n\n- Accounting\n- Business Analytics\n- Entrepreneurship\n- Finance\n- Healthcare\u00a0(for students entering before Spring 2022)\n- Healthcare\u00a0(for students entering Spring 2022 and beyond)\n- Information Technology\n- International Business\n- Managerial Leadership\n- Marketing\n\nFor more information about the Master of Business Administration, contact:Manning School of Business Graduate CoordinatorsPhone: 978-934-2848Email:mba@uml.edu\n\nUpdated 2/29/24\n\n\n\n## Quick Links\n\n- Request Information\n- Apply\n- Check Application Status\n- Visit\n\n"

The Thesis Committee shall consist of at least three members, at least two of whom shall be from the student's major department. One member of the committee shall be the student's thesis advisor. An outside expert, such as the supervisor of a research project conducted at an industrial setting or a faculty member from another institution, may be a member of the committee, but that individual must possess academic credentials which would qualify him or her to serve as a member of the University of Massachusetts Lowell faculty.\n\nThe M.S.E. degree, and the appropriate Graduate Certificate (the area of specialization), will be awarded upon satisfactory completion of 30 credit hours of study as outlined. More detailed descriptions of the \"Thesis Option\" requirements are given below.\n\nAdmission Requirements and Prerequisites:\u2060\n\nAdmission to the program is open to candidates with a B.S. in Plastics Engineering or a related engineering or science field. The pre-requisite math requirements include Calculus II and Differential Equations. Applicants must also provide two recommendation letters, an Official Transcript, and a Statement of Purpose as per the UMass Lowell Graduate Admissions Policy. This program no longer requires official GRE scores. You can apply online and see all the requirements atGraduate Admissions.\n\nNon-matriculated students (with an appropriate B.S. Degree) may begin taking courses without application to the M.S.E. Plastics Engineering Program. It is recommended, however, that students apply to the M.S.E. Program as soon as possible (i.e. prior to taking too many course credits) since there is no guarantee of acceptance into the M.S.E. Program. In addition, no more than 12 credit hours taken as a non-matriculated student can be transferred into the M.S.E. Program upon acceptance.\n\nStudents may transfer as many as 12 science or engineering graduate course credits from other universities provided they are approved by the Plastics Engineering Department's M.S.E. program coordinator. (For University regulations regardingtransfer creditand other regulations, st theGraduate Policiesin the on-line catalog.)\n\nGraduate Student Advising:\u2060\n\nOne of the graduate coordinators will be the academic advisor for students enrolled in the non-thesis M.S.E. Plastics Engineering Degree Program. The advisor will help the student remedy deficiencies in prerequisites, select electives of most value, and plan the overall study program efficiently. The thesis advisor will be the chairperson of the thesis advisory committee that will guide the student in the thesis research and supervise the completion of the thesis requirement. Once an advisor is selected, the student and advisor should complete the Departmental Advising Form, indicating the thesis topic. Both the student and advisor must sign this form before the student can register for thesis credits. This form is available in the Plastics Engineering Department Office (B204) and should be submitted to the graduate program coordinator.\n\nnon-thesisNon-thesis Option\n\nStudents enrolled in the non-thesis M.S. Plastics Engineering option must complete a total of 33 course credits as outlined in the course requirements section below.\n\nRequirement 1Complete the \"core course\" requirements (18 credits)\n\n- PLAS.5030 - Mechanical Behavior of Polymers (3 credits)\n- PLAS.5440 - Advanced Plastics Materials (3 credits)\n- PLAS.5780 - Advanced Plastics Processing (3 credits)\n- PLAS.5060 - Polymer Structure Properties and Applications (3 credits)\n- PLAS.5180 - Plastics Product Design (3 credits)\n- PLAS.5730\u00a0Graduate Polymer Laboratory (3 credit) OR PLAS.5731 Hybrid Graduate Polymer Laboratory I (1 credit) and PLAS.5732 Hybrid Graduate Polymer Laboratory II (2 credits)\n\nSpecial notes for students having a Plastics Engineering B.S. Degree:\n\nStudents who have a B.S. Degree in Plastics Engineering from UMass Lowell or an equivalent program may elect to test out of Advanced Plastics Materials (PLAS.5440) and Advanced Plastics Processing (PLAS.5780). However, these students must still meet the 33 credit hour program requirement by substituting other Plastics Engineering Graduate Courses.\n\nRequirement 2:Complete the course requirements for one or more of the department's graduate \"Certificates\".\n\n- Plastics Desing\n- Plastics Materials\n- Plastics Processing\n- Medical Plastics Design and Manufacturing\n- Elastomeric Materials\n\nSome of the certificate course requirements may also be core requirements. The course requirements for each graduate certificate are also outlined below.\n\nNote:The Graduate Certificate in \"Plastics Engineering Fundamentals\" does not satisfy Requirement 2 for the thesis option M.S.E. Plastics Engineering Program.\n\nRequirement 3Complete the requirements for an additional number of elective plastics graduate courses such that the \"total\" credit hours (core courses + certificate + electives) is 33 credits. Up to two elective courses from other engineering departments may be substituted if approved by the graduate coordinator.\n\nThe M.S.E. degree, and the appropriate Graduate Certificate (the area of specialization), will be awarded upon satisfactory completion of 33 credit hours of study as specified above. This non-thesis M.S.E. degree is an alternative to the more traditional 30 credit thesis option M.S.E degree.\n\nprerequisitesAdmission Requirements and Prerequisites:\n\nAdmission to the program is open to candidates with a B.S. in Plastics Engineering or a related engineering or science field. The pre-requisite math requirements include Calculus II and Differential Equations. Applicants must also provide three letters of reference, an official transcript, and a Statement of Purpose as per the UMass Lowell Graduate Admissions Policy.\u00a0 You can apply online atwww.uml.edu/grad.\n\nThe foundation \"Plastics\" courses required in previous years are no longer required. Students who have taken these foundation graduate courses in the past can receive some graduate course credit for these courses as outlined above.\n\nThe Plastics Engineering Department makes every attempt to offer as many of these courses as possible during the evening so that students having full time jobs can complete the degree program. Return to the home page for a listing of evening graduate courses for the next few semesters.\n\nNon-matriculated students (with an appropriate B.S. Degree) may begin taking courses without application to the M.S.E. Plastics Engineering Program. However, it is recommended that students apply to the M.S.E. Program as soon as possible (i.e. prior to taking too many course credits) since there is no guarantee of acceptance into the M.S.E. Program. In addition, no more than 12 credit hours taken as a non-matriculated student can be transferred into the M.S.E. Program upon acceptance.\n\ngrad-advisingGraduate Student Advising:\n\nThe M.S.E. Coordinator will be the academic advisor for students enrolled in the non-thesis M.S.E. Plastics Engineering Degree Program. The coordinator will help the student remedy deficiencies in prerequisites, select electives of most value, and plan the overall study program efficiently.\n\nFull Time vs. Part Time Status\n\nBoth the Thesis and Non-thesis Option M.S.E. Plastics Engineering Programs are open to full-time and part-time students. Many of the courses required for these programs are offered at night so that engineers working at local companies can take advantage of the programs. Students taking fewer than nine credits in a semester are considered part time, while those taking nine or more credits are considered full time students. Graduate students must maintain full-time student status in order to be eligible for research assistant positions (R.A.).\n\nFunding Policy- Plastics Engineering Graduate Students\n\nResearch Assistant Positions(R.A.) positions, either \"full time\" or \"half time\", are awarded by individual faculty\u00a0who conduct funded research. Accepted students must correspond with the individual faculty to inquire about R.A. positions. Faculty research interests are listed in the Faculty section of the department web site. It is recommended that applicants interested in obtaining R.A. funding should send a letter and resume to those faculty having similar research interests.\n\nUpdated 3/7/24\n\n## Quick Links\n\n- Request Information\n- Apply\n- Check Application Status\n- Visit\n\n"

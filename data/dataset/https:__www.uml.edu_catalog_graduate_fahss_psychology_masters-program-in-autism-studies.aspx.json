Credit\n- Part-Time Study and Non-Degree Status\n- Graduate Advisor\n- Degree Requirements\n- Thesis Option\n- Bachelors to Master's Program\n- Partnership with Lasell\n\nAdmission Requirements\n\nThe Applied Behavior Analysis & Autism Studies graduate program at the University of Massachusetts Lowell is designed not only for recent college graduates, but also for students with experience in a variety of educational and work settings.\n\nIn addition to the requirements for graduate admission, requirements for the Applied Behavior Analysis & Autism Studies graduate program include these factors:\n\nThese criteria may be applied or weighted differently for different students. For example, for students just receiving a bachelor's degree, greater attention will be paid to recent grades. For students out of school for some time, work background and experience will count relatively more. Please follow the procedures for application established by theGraduate Admissions Office.\n\n## Transfer Credit\n\nMatriculated students in Applied Behavior Analysis & Autism Studies who come to UMass Lowell with prior graduate work at other schools may request a transfer of a maximum of 12 credit hours. An assessment will be conducted to determine how courses proposed for transfer map onto our courses with respect to BACB requirements. Such transfer credit is subject to the approval of the Graduate Coordinator and the Registrar's Office and must meet the university'sGraduate Transfer Credit requirements. For students who have completed courses from the\u00a0 Applied Behavior Analysis Certificate Program (courses listed below)\u00a0up to 21 credits of those courses may count towards the Master's.\n\n- PSYC.5810\n- PSYC.5820\n- PSYC.5830\n- PSYC.5840\n- PSYC.5850\n- PSYC.5870\n- PSYC.5890\n\nPart-time Study and Non-Degree Status\n\nWhile most Applied Behavior Analysis & Autism Studies students attend UMass Lowell for full-time study, part-time students are encouraged to apply. Many courses are offered online, while on-campus courses are usually offered at late afternoon and evening hours to accommodate students who are employed. Students not pursuing an advanced degree or who wish to begin their graduate study without first applying for matriculated status are invited to register as non-degree students for specific graduate courses on a space-available basis. Such students only need to meet the first two of the admissions requirements listed above.\n\nIf a non-degree student later applies for acceptance into the master\u2019s program, the application will be treated equally with those of other new applicants, though performance in graduate courses taken on campus will be used as an additional admissions criterion. Non-degree students accepted as matriculated students may apply to transfer a maximum of 6 graduate credits earned at the University of Massachusetts Lowell with a grade of \"B\" or better toward the master\u2019s degree. Students who are enrolled in a UMass Lowell certificate program may be able to transfer more than 6 credits.\n\nGraduate Advisor\n\nEach newly matriculated student in the program will be assigned a faculty advisor. The student will meet with his or her advisor on a regular basis to discuss course selection, planning for practicum, and the development of an optional thesis or project. Once a student selects a faculty supervisor for his or/her thesis or project, that faculty member takes over as graduate academic advisor.\n\nDegree Requirements\n\nA total of 39 academic credits, is required for the completion of the degree. At least 30 of these credits must be taken at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. No more than two courses (6 credits) may have an earned grade of less than B (3.000).The 39 credits for the Master\u2019s degree are divided as follows:\n\nApplied Behavior Analysis Option:\n\nCourse Requirements- 27 creditsSupervised Practicum- 6 creditsElectives or Thesis- 6 credits\n\nStudents may select from any the approved elective courses in Psychology, almost all of which are offered once every two years. Students may also, when appropriate, request permission to take related courses from other graduate programs at UMass Lowell. In their choice of electives, students in the ABA option can choose to complete a Master's Thesis, which involves original empirical research (the Master's Thesis is required for the Autism Studies option).\n\nFoundations(9 credits):\n\n- PSYC.5810 Behavior Concepts & Principles of Behavior Analysis\n- PSYC.5830 Philosophical Underpinnings of Behavior Analysis\n- PSYC.6630 Experimental Analysis of Behavior\n\nMethods(6 credits):\n\n- PSYC.5120 Applied Research Methods\n- PSYC.5820 Measurement & Experimental Design\n\nBehavioral Assessment, Intervention, and Ethics(12 credits):\n\n- PSYC.5840 Behavioral Assessment\n- PSYC.5850 Professional & Ethical Issues in Behavior Analysis\n- PSYC.5870 Behavior Change Procedures\n- PSYC.5890 Implementation & Supervision Practices in Behavior Analysis\n\nSupervised Practicum(6 credits total):\n\n- PSYC.5900 Professional Seminar in Applied Behavior Analysis (0 credit)\n- PSYC.6710 Supervised Practicum\n- PSYC.6720 Supervised Practicum\n\nElectives or Thesis Option(6 credits total):\n\nElectives Option (6 credits total; choose any two of the following):\n\n- PSYC.5000 Introductory to Community Social Psychology\n- PSYC.5010 Applied Developmental Psychology\n- PSYC.5040 The Family System\n- PSYC.5220 Psychology of Diversity\n- PSYC.5450 Community & Organizational Change\n- PSYC.5460 Grant Writing\n- PSYC.5740 Social & Community Interventions in Autism\n- PSYC.6110 Program Evaluation\n- PSYC.6300 Educating Diverse Populations\n- PSYC.6423 Program Evaluation\n\nThesis Option(6 credits):\n\n- PSYC.7440 Master's Thesis\n\nAutism Studies Option:\n\nCore Requirements -24 creditsSupervised Practicum -3 creditsThesis -6 creditsElectives -9 credits\n\nStudents may select from any of the approved elective courses in Psychology, almost all of which are offered once every two years. Students may also, when appropriate request permission to take related courses from other graduate programs at UMass Lowell. At least one elective in the Research Intensive option must be an approved Methods Course.\n\nFoundations(6 credits):\n\n- PSYC.5710 Autism and Developmental Psychopathology\n- PSYC.5740 Social & Community Interventions\n- PSYC.5810 Behavior Concepts & Principles of Behavior Analysis\n\nMethods(6 credits):\n\n- PSYC.5120 Applied Research Methods\n- PSYC.5820 Measurement and Experimental Design\n- PSYC.6500 Advanced Quantitative Methods\n\nSupervised Practicum(3 credits total):\n\n- PSYC.6710 Supervised Practicum\n\nDirected Study or Thesis(9 credits total):\n\n- PSYC.5920 Directed Study in Autism Studies (3 credits)\n- PSYC.7440 Master's Thesis in Autism Studies (6 credits)\n\nElective Option(9 credits total; 3 credits must be a methods course):\n\n- PSYC.5010 Applied Developmental Psychology\n- PSYC.5040 The Family System\n- PSYC.5080 The Child in the Community\n- PSYC.5220 Psychology of Diversity\n- PSYC.5460 Grant Writing\n- PSYC.5840\u00a0Behavioral\u00a0Assessment\n- PSYC.5870 Behavior Change Procedures\n- PSYC.5450 Community and Organizational Change\n- PSYC.6110 Program Evaluation\n- PSYC.6940 Method Research Experience\n- PSYC.7020 Participatory Action Research\n- PUBH.5060 Quantitative Methods in Healthcare Management\n\nThesis Requirements\n\nTo earn the 39 credits needed for the master's degree, all matriculated students in Autism Studies have the option of completing a thesis. The thesis will always be a piece of quantitative and/or qualitative research, involving a review of literature, a clear statement of a research question, the design of an appropriate method for collecting data, and the analysis of results as the basis for drawing conclusions. The thesis must:\n\n- be completed over the course of two semesters (usually consecutive), counting for 6 credits toward the degree,\n- involve a Thesis Committee of three faculty,\n- be written in accordance with University guidelines, and\n- be defended by the student in front of the Thesis Committee at a public meeting.\n\nBachelor's to Master's Program\n\nUndergraduate psychology majors at the University of Massachusetts Lowell who have a GPA of 3.000 or better are invited to apply to the Bachelor's-Master's program. This program allows students to begin graduate level coursework in our Applied Behavior Analysis & Autism Studies Master\u2019s program while still pursuing their bachelor's degree. Up to 6 credits of graduate (5000 level or higher) courses completed with a B grade (3.000) or better may be used by the student to count toward both the Bachelor\u2019s and Master's degrees.\n\nApplication to the Bachelor's to Master's Program\n\nApplication is typically summit during the student's second semester of theirjunior yearto allow adequate time for the student to take maximum advantage of the opportunity to take graduate courses and double-count these graduate credits, while still staying within the maximum of 45 psychology credits allowable for the undergraduate degree in psychology. Although it is highly recommended that students submit their application during their junior year, application materials can be submitted at any time prior to graduation. However, applications for the Bachelor's to Master's program will be reviewed along with all other applications during the review cycle each semester. Application forms and details on applying to graduate school can be accessed from theGraduate Admissions website.\n\nAs additional advantages, students applying under the Bachelor's-Master's option do not have to pay the standard application fee. The decision to accept aBachelor's-Master'sapplicant is based on three factors:\n\nPartnership with Lasell University\u2060\n\nIf you are a Lasell University student who has applied to the Interdisciplinary Training Program,please read about the partnership requirements.\n\n## Quick Links\n\n- Request Information\n- Apply\n- Check Application Status\n- Visit\n\n"

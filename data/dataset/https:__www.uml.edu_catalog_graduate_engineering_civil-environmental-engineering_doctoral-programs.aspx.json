Successful applicants are expected to perform advanced research in one or more areas of concentration within the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and successfully complete both core courses and electives that may be drawn from a variety of disciplines. Beyond the core courses, the program can be tailored to the needs of each student through a formal arrangement between the student and his or her research advisor.\n\nAreas of Concentration\n\nThe areas of concentration within the Doctor of Philosophy in Civil and Environmental Engineering are:\n\n- Environmental Engineering\n- Geoenvironmental Engineering\n- Geotechnical Engineering\n- Transportation Engineering\n- Structural Engineering\n\nProgram Curriculum\n\nIn addition to the general degree requirements described earlier, students are required to take the Core Courses in one of the program concentration areas listed below.\n\n- Core for Environmental Engineering Concentration\nCIVE.5610 Physical and Chemical Treatment Processes\nCIVE.5620 Physical and Chemical Hydrogeology\nCIVE.5670 Environmental Aquatic Chemistry\nCIVE.5680 Environmental Fate and Transport\nCIVE.5780 Biological Wastewater Treatment\nCIVE.5950 Hazardous Waste Site Remediation\n- CIVE.5610 Physical and Chemical Treatment Processes\n- CIVE.5620 Physical and Chemical Hydrogeology\n- CIVE.5670 Environmental Aquatic Chemistry\n- CIVE.5680 Environmental Fate and Transport\n- CIVE.5780 Biological Wastewater Treatment\n- CIVE.5950 Hazardous Waste Site Remediation\n- Core for Geoenvironmental Engineering Concentration\nCIVE.5310 Advanced Soil Mechanics\nCIVE.5360 Soil Engineering\nCIVE.5620 Physical and Chemical Hydrogeology\nCIVE.5670 Environmental Aquatic Chemistry\nCIVE.5950 Hazardous Waste Site Remediation\n- CIVE.5310 Advanced Soil Mechanics\n- CIVE.5360 Soil Engineering\n- CIVE.5620 Physical and Chemical Hydrogeology\n- CIVE.5670 Environmental Aquatic Chemistry\n- CIVE.5950 Hazardous Waste Site Remediation\n\n- CIVE.5610 Physical and Chemical Treatment Processes\n- CIVE.5620 Physical and Chemical Hydrogeology\n- CIVE.5670 Environmental Aquatic Chemistry\n- CIVE.5680 Environmental Fate and Transport\n- CIVE.5780 Biological Wastewater Treatment\n- CIVE.5950 Hazardous Waste Site Remediation\n\n- CIVE.5310 Advanced Soil Mechanics\n- CIVE.5360 Soil Engineering\n- CIVE.5620 Physical and Chemical Hydrogeology\n- CIVE.5670 Environmental Aquatic Chemistry\n- CIVE.5950 Hazardous Waste Site Remediation\n\nand at least one of the following:\n\n- CIVE.5290 Engineering with Geosynthetics\n- CIVE.5380 Soil Behavior\n- CIVE.5270 Geotechnical and Environmental Site Characterization\n- Core for Geotechnical Engineering Concentration\nCIVE.5310 Advanced Soil Mechanics\n- CIVE.5310 Advanced Soil Mechanics\n\n- CIVE.5310 Advanced Soil Mechanics\n\n(and any four of the following:)\n\n- CIVE.5270 Geotechnical and Environmental Site Characterization\n- CIVE.5290 Engineering with Geosynthetics\n- CIVE.5300 Deep Foundations\n- CIVE.5320 Theoretical Soil Mechanics\n- CIVE.5330 Advanced Foundation Engineering\n- CIVE.5340 Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering\n- CIVE.5360 Soil Engineering\n- CIVE.5370 Experimental Soil Mechanics\n- CIVE.5380 Soil Behavior\n- CIVE.5390 Ground Improvement\n\n- Core for Transportation Engineering Concentration\nCIVE.5400 Urban Transportation Planning\nCIVE.5410 Traffic Engineering\nCIVE.5810 Engineering Systems Analysis\nCIVE.5830 Stochastic Concepts\n- CIVE.5400 Urban Transportation Planning\n- CIVE.5410 Traffic Engineering\n- CIVE.5810 Engineering Systems Analysis\n- CIVE.5830 Stochastic Concepts\n\n- CIVE.5400 Urban Transportation Planning\n- CIVE.5410 Traffic Engineering\n- CIVE.5810 Engineering Systems Analysis\n- CIVE.5830 Stochastic Concepts\n\n- Core for Structural Engineering Concentration\nCIVE.5040 Advanced Strength of Materials\nCIVE.5510 Design of Steel Structures or\nCIVE.5520 Design of Reinforced Concrete Structures\nCIVE.5560 Finite Element Analysis or equivalent\nCIVE.5570 Structural Dynamics\n- CIVE.5040 Advanced Strength of Materials\n- CIVE.5510 Design of Steel Structures or\n- CIVE.5520 Design of Reinforced Concrete Structures\n- CIVE.5560 Finite Element Analysis or equivalent\n- CIVE.5570 Structural Dynamics\n\n- CIVE.5040 Advanced Strength of Materials\n- CIVE.5510 Design of Steel Structures or\n- CIVE.5520 Design of Reinforced Concrete Structures\n- CIVE.5560 Finite Element Analysis or equivalent\n- CIVE.5570 Structural Dynamics\n\nAdmissions Requirements\n\nAdmission to applicants who have at least one degree in engineering from an accredited university and department requires high academic standing in all prior course work. Admission may be also offered to applicants who hold a Bachelor's and/or Master's degree in non-engineering fields. In such cases, the applicant must successfully complete all requirements for a Master of Science in Civil and Environmental Engineering prior to being considered a candidate for the Doctor of Philosophy degree.\u00a0Applicants must meet allGraduate Admissions standardsfor this program, which includes three letters of recommendation, and official GRE scores.\n\nPlan of Study\n\nWithin about one academic year of initiation of doctoral study, each student must work with his/her research advisor to develop a Plan of Study that complies with doctoral program and University policies. Courses substitutions in the Plan of Study must be reviewed by the Departmental Graduate Committee. Formal requests for substitutions are made by the student's Research Advisor. The student's Research Advisor is the supervisor of the student's research activities. The Advisor will work with the student to develop Dissertation research focus and request the service of appropriately qualified persons in the student's Dissertation Committee. The Dissertation Committee will comprise a minimum of 4 persons of which at least 2 will be full time, regular faculty members of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. The function of the Dissertation Committee is to ensure that the final edition of the student's dissertation meets the high technical standards expected in doctoral work and that the student successfully defends his/her findings prior to the award of the doctorate degree. Dissertation Committee members are not necessarily co-investigators of the student's research topic.\n\nQualifying Examination\n\nUpon the completion of a maximum of 45 credit hours of graduate work that count towards the doctoral degree, the student will apply to the Dissertation Committee to take a Qualifying Examination. In addition, students who were admitted as non-engineering degree holders into the Doctor of Philosophy program must satisfy all requirements for the award of the M.S. degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering before they are allowed to take the Qualifying Examination. The Qualifying Examination may be written and oral. The Dissertation Committee members will submit their grades to the Doctoral Program Coordinator who will tally them and report the overall grade on a pass/fail basis, to the student and his/her advisor. Students who successfully complete the Qualifying Examination will be designated as Candidates for the Doctor of Philosophy degree. For each doctoral student, a maximum of two Qualifying Examinations will be allowed. A doctoral student who fails the Qualifying Examination two times will not be allowed to continue in the doctoral program. Shortly after passing the Qualifying Examination, the Doctoral degree candidate will be expected to develop a thesis plan in collaboration with his/her advisor, and defend it successfully before the Doctoral Committee.\n\nPh.D. Program in Chemistry - Environmental Studies Option\n\nA Ph.D. in Chemistry with an option in Environmental Studies is offered jointly by the Department of Chemistry and the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. The program is described in detail in theChemistry Departmentsection of this catalog.\n\n## Quick Links\n\n- Request Information\n- Apply\n- Check Application Status\n- Visit\n\n"

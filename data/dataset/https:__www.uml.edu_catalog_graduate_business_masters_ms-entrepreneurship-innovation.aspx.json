In conversations with executive staff in major companies in the region we have been told repeatedly that the region\u2019s engineers and scientists need to be entrepreneurial. As competition and costs rise, research and development efforts must clearly contribute to business growth and the company bottom line. Thus, companies are looking for technical professionals who can generate new ideas and new businesses.\n\nThe goal of the Master of Science in Entrepreneurship and Innovation (MSEI) is to provide all students (engineers, business, scientists social, arts, etc.) with the skills and knowledge required to drive innovation in today\u2019s collaborative, global workforce. Using a combination of class work, case work and real-world project activity, students will:\n\n- Understand and leverage the business opportunities accompanying low- to high- technology innovation within established companies and through the launch of new ventures.\n- Develop an understanding of technology innovation and entrepreneurship from both an academic and applied perspective.\n- Learn how to appropriately value and finance technology innovations and new ventures.\n- Develop the market research and sales skills necessary to position technology innovations to create competitive advantage.\n- Develop the management skills required to identify, launch and execute innovative products, services and new ventures.\n- Develop an applied understanding of the regulatory and property law issues accompanying the innovation and entrepreneurship processes.\n- Develop the project management and interdisciplinary team skills required to manage in an open collaboration environment.\n\nA graduate of the MSEI program should be prepared to manage innovation in established firms, or to launch new technology-oriented ventures.\n\n## POSProgram of StudyProgram\n\nThe MSEI consists of ten courses (30 credits), including 4 core courses (12 credits), 4 elective courses (12 credits, 6 of which must be in Engineering and/or Science) and a 2 course (6 credit) practicum. Each student will participate in the development and delivery of a team capstone project (through the 2 course practicum) which will be reviewed by an external professional panel.\n\nThe courses in the Manning School of Business are currently offered in an accelerated 8-week format. Student are allowed to register for a maximum of two courses (6 credits) per 8 week term.\u00a0In order to petition to take more than two courses per 8-week term, the student needs to submit a graduate academic petition to the Manning School Graduate Office.\n\n- MS in Entrepreneurship and Innovation degree pathway\n- MS in Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Engineering option, degree pathway\n\n## Part-Time and Full-Time StudyPart\n\nStudents are admitted on either a part-time or full-time basis. Courses meet during the evening hours beginning at 6 p.m., with additional online and blended course options.\n\nPart-time students are expected to graduate within two years. For an MS student, the full-time course load is nine credits. Degree requirements usually are completed in one year for students attending full-time.\n\n## Admissions RequirementsAdmission\n\n## **This program is no longer accepting applications aside from Development Command Soldier Center (DEVCOM SC) students.\n\nTarget Audience\n\nThe Program will be offered to engineering, science and select business graduates as a 5th year program (the University's Bachelor's to Master's program) and to working professionals with an appropriate undergraduate degree in business, science, technology or engineering.\n\nWorking Professionals\n\nAdmissions to the program will be determined based on an overall review of the following applicant materials: undergraduate degree and performance in science, engineering or business (other areas will be considered if the applicant demonstrates significant work experience in a technical field), two letters of recommendation (professional and academic) and a letter describing the applicant's professional goals and how earning a MS will assist in their professional development. For applicants from non-English speaking countries, a minimum score of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or 600 (paper-based) or 100 (internet-based) must be obtained.\n\nPlease note that as of February 2023, the GMAT or GRE is no longer required.\n\nThe Bachelor's to Master's Program\n\nThe Bachelor's to Master's Program option offered by the College of Management is an accelerated program offered to encourage outstanding undergraduate students in engineering, science and business to continue study at the graduate level. Undergraduate students in these majors (i.e., science, engineering or business), who have a GPA of 3.000 or better at the end of their junior year must apply for this program before they complete their undergraduate graduation requirements. Students who plan to apply to this program must meet with the MS program advisor by their junior year to discuss any additional course requirements.\n\nGeneral eligibility guidelines for admissions to a UMass Lowell Bachelor's to Master's Program.\n\nFor more information on the MSEI admissions process, please visit theMS in Entrepreneurship and Innovation Prospective Student page.\n\n## Contact:\n\nManning School of Business, Graduate Program OfficeMichael Ciuchta: 978-934-2993 orMSE@uml.edu\n\n## Course Descriptions:Course\n\nENTR.6500 Innovation and Emerging Technologies (3 credits)This course examines technological innovation and its relationship to value-creation and business strategy. emphasis is placed on emerging scientific and technical innovations and the opportunities and challenges they present to both existing businesses and new venture entrepreneurs.

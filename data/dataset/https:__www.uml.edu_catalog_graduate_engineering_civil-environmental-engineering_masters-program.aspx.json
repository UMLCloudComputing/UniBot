Official GRE scores are no longer required for this program.\n\n## Program Description and General Requirements\n\nGraduate study in Civil Engineering is an intensive program of instruction at an advanced technical level. The program permits students to design, in consultation with their advisor, a plan of study that meets individual goals and career objectives.\n\nProgram options include environmental engineering, geo-environmental engineering, geotechnical engineering, structural engineering and transportation engineering.\n\nThe degree requires successful completion of 30 credit hours of course work, or 24 credit hours of instruction and a publishable thesis, or 27 hours of course work and preparation of a project report.\n\nCourses are scheduled in the late afternoon and evening to provide study opportunities for students with full-time employment. Successful completion of undergraduate prerequisite courses is required prior to registering for graduate courses. However, undergraduate prerequisites and selected graduate courses, that do not have prerequisites, may be taken during the first year of study, but only with the written permission of the student\u2019s advisor. Required undergraduate prerequisite courses are listed in descriptions of the core graduate courses shown below.\n\nApplicants who satisfy graduate admission requirements will be assigned to a faculty member who will serve as their academic advisor. Students receiving a teaching or research assistantship will normally be required to submit a publishable thesis. Those admitted to graduate study as non-degree students may apply for matriculated status. However, no more than 12 credits of work completed while in non-degree student status or transferred from another department or college will be used toward a degree. Matriculated status is preferred before initial registration and is mandatory prior to registration for second semester courses.

Others may be admitted with the approval of the Graduate Program Coordinator. Such students may make up course prerequisite deficiencies while in the program, although these credits will not count toward the total required for the master\u2019s degree. Frequently, students entering the program are required to take a number of undergraduate courses to develop the analytical skills, and to prepare for the advanced level courses.\n\nThe M.Sc. program requires the completion of 30 credits, 9 in core courses, and 15 in elective courses listed below. Six credits may be achieved by completing a Master's Thesis. The thesis involves original laboratory or theoretical work, usually publishable in accredited and peer reviewed technical journals. With the Graduate Program Coordinator\u2019s approval, the thesis work may be performed at home or at the student\u2019s employment facilities. The thesis advisory committee will consist of a Principal Advisor who is the member of the EEAS faculty, and two members chosen from EEAS or associated UMass Lowell faculty. One member may be from outside the University, with the approval of the Graduate Coordinator. Students may elect to take additional courses instead of writing a thesis.\n\nMost of the courses are offered in the evening, usually from 6 to 9 p.m., once per week. This enables working students to complete the course requirements while the student is employed. A maximum of 5 years is allowed for completion of the master\u2019s degree, including the thesis.\n\n## Core Courses\n\n- ATMO.5010 Boundary Layer Meteorology\n- ENVI.5750/CHEM.5750 Physical Chemistry for Environmental Studies\n- Chose one of the two following courses:\n- PUBH.527/ENVE.5270 Environmental Law and Policy\n- ECON.615 Environmental and Natural Resources Economics\n\n## Elective Courses\n\n- ATMO.5020 Advanced Synoptic Meteorology\n- ATMO.5030 Remote Sensing of the Atmosphere\n- ATMO.5110 Solar Terrestrial Relations\n- ATMO.5150 Atmospheric Structure and Dynamics\n- ATMO.5230 Air Pollution Control\n- ATMO.5710 Air Pollution Phenomenology\n- ATMO.6730 / PUBH.6170 Air Pollution Laboratory/Measurement of Airborne Contaminants\n- ATMO.6740 Air Quality Modeling\n- ENVI.5720 Energy and the Environment\n- PUBH.5140 Aerosol Science\n- MATH.5500 Mathematical Modeling\n- RADI.6130 Environmental Monitoring and Surveillance (Radionuclides)\n\n## Quick Links\n\n- Request Information\n- Apply\n- Check Application Status\n- Visit\n\n"

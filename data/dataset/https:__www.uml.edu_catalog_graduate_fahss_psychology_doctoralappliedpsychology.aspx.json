advanced education in the application of psychological theories and methods to address real-world problems, as well as to promote optimal quality of life outcomes. APPS emphasizes four core areas of study:\n\nAn applied psychological approach that emphasizes the importance of preventing problems and promoting positive behavior in these areas builds on expertise of our faculty, enriches students\u2019 understanding of the importance of prevention, expands involvement with communities, enhances research skills, and increases opportunities for students\u2019 career success.\n\nTheApplied Cognitive Psychologycore area is designed to teach our graduate students how to address real-world issues. Students will be trained to develop evidence-based reforms rooted in a rigorous study of cognitive processes. Such reforms can be applied to confront problems in the domains of education, law, health, and business. Ongoing research in the department explores how to improve the accuracy of both memory performance and meta-cognitive judgments to help students choose optimal study strategies and help legal actors assess eyewitness reliability. Other faculty study health campaign design, the relationship between language and cognition, memory for trauma, and/or issues that face individuals making decisions within the criminal justice system.\n\nTheCommunity and Applied Social Psychologycore area is designed to train students to research and analyze the complex relationships between individual, family, and community well-being and the broader socioeconomic, physical, cultural, and geographic environment. This track will produce graduates with the analytic, creative, and practical skills needed to design and implement programs and services that will facilitate positive changes within and across communities. A number of members of our department specialize in issues facing immigrants, psychology and the law, peace and conflict issues both nationally and internationally, positive aging, intersectionality of race/ethnicity, diversity issues in the workplace, participatory action research, and gender-based violence.\n\nTheApplied Developmental Psychologycore area will train our graduates to conduct research on typical and atypical challenges across the lifespan. Faculty areas of research include neuropsychology, psychophysiology, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD), child maltreatment, and the development of language, especially the ability to tell narratives of personal experiences. Other faculty address issues of family and parent-child relationships, child eyewitness testimony, and aging and social gerontology.\n\nTheApplied Behavior Analysiscore area is designed to provide interdisciplinary training within psychology and\u00a0and behavior analysis. Students will be trained as both researchers and scientist-practitioners in the discovery and application of knowledge to solve problems of societal importance. Faculty research in this core area includes educational and occupational development of people on the autism spectrum and in particular members from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, applications of verbal behavior, applications of behavior analysis to instructional design in higher education, as well as staff and parent training.\n\nProgram ObjectivesPOB\n\nThe doctoral degree in Applied Psychology & Prevention Science at UMass Lowell is a psychology-based, research-oriented degree. The program is designed to provide a theoretically grounded and methodologically sophisticated education, and will train students and working professionals in the application of psychological knowledge for improving overall health and wellness at multiple levels, including health promotion and disease prevention. The curriculum of the APPS PhD program is geared toward gaining new knowledge and skills through study, research, and experiential learning opportunities and to meeting the needs of public and private sectors that may serve as potential employers for the program\u2019s graduates.\n\nKnowKnowledge Competencies\n\n- An understanding of the key concepts, theories, and methodology in the field of Applied Psychology and Prevention Science;\n- Ability to assess the costs and benefits of intervention programs designed to prevent problematic behavior, promote health behaviors, and maximize individual and organizational potential and well-being.\n- An understanding of and ability to work well with and empower diverse, underrepresented groups in real-world settings;\n- A thorough grounding in the ethical conduct of research and practice in real-world settings\n\nSkill SetSkill\n\n- Utilize quantitative and qualitative methods to conduct psychological research on major issues related to promoting healthy outcomes, preventing problematic behaviors, and/or intervening to diminish existing problems;\n- Assess the effectiveness of organizations and programs;\n- Analyze social problems and design appropriate interventions;\n- Develop the ability to carry out systemic interventions on multiple levels.\n\nAREQAdmission Requirements\n\nFor more information about the Application Deadline, consult thePsychology Application Page:\n\n1. Applicants should arrange to have (an) official transcript(s) indicating that they have earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree, and, if relevant, an official transcript indicating that they have earned a Master\u2019s degree (or will in the near future) mailed to the Office of Graduate Admissions by the degree-granting institution(s) at:\n\nGraduate AdmissionsGraduate & Professional Studies Center839 Merrimack St., 2nd FloorLowell, MA 01854-5104\n\nTranscripts are required from every college or university attended with the following exceptions:\n\n- Transcripts are not required from colleges or universities where a one-semester study abroad or domestic exchange was completed;\n- Transcripts are not required from colleges or universities for which the course names and grades were transferred to the applicant\u2019s bachelor\u2019s or Master\u2019s degree-granting institution (and appear on those transcripts).\n\n2. International students who are unable to provide official transcripts to the Office of Graduate Admissions must demonstrate that they have earned the equivalent of a Bachelor\u2019s degree granted by an accredited United States institution before their application will be processed.

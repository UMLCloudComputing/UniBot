The certificate is designed to respond to the need for trained professionals who are responsible for managing complex engineering systems integrating algorithms, information, software and hardware. Completion of certificate courses in areas complementary to the individual's specific training will serve as an important starting point for engineering managers (and prospective managers) who need to solve complex interdisciplinary problems at the interfaces of electrical, computer, mechanical, materials engineering, and computer science and applied physics.\n\nThe program consists of six clusters:\n\nWithin each cluster, there are a number of carefully selected courses ranging from introductory graduate level to more advanced, specialized electives.\n\nStudents must successfully complete four courses (12 credits), one or two of which may be taken in their area of expertise. The remaining courses must be taken in separate and different cluster areas. Courses are selected in consultation with one (or more) graduate program coordinators to best meet the student's needs in terms of background, interests, and work requirements. It may be necessary for students to take prerequisite course(s) if they do not have appropriate backgrounds for a particular cluster course.\n\n## CLUSTER AREAS AND DESIGNATED COURSES:\n\n## APPLIED PHYSICS\n\n- PHYS.5530 Electromagnetism I\n- PHYS.5540 Electromagnetism II\n- PHYS.5400 Image Processing (4 credits)\n- PHYS.5780 Integrated Optics: Wave Guide and Lasers\n- PHYS.5350 Introduction of Quantum Mechanics I\n- PHYS.5470 Laser Physics and Applications\n- PHYS.5380 Physical Optics and Waves\n- PHYS.5770 Solid State Electronic and Opto-Electronic Devices\n- PHYS.5210 Statistical Thermodynamics\n\n## COMPUTER ENGINEERING\n\n- EECE.5500 Advanced Digital System Design\n- EECE.5610 Computer Architecture Design\n- EECE.5810 Computer Vision and Digital Image Processing\n- EECE.5100 Digital Signal Processing\n- EECE.5720 Embedded Real-Time Systems\n- EECE.5750 FPGA Logic Design Techniques\n- EECE.5520 Microprocessors Systems II and Embedded Systems\n- EECE.5820 Network Design: Principles, Protocols, and Applications\n- EECE.5730 Operating Systems and Kernel Design for Computer Engineers\n- EECE.5210 Real Time DSP\n- EECE.5020 VLSI Design\n- EECE.5040 VLSI Fabrication\n\n## COMPUTER SCIENCE\n\n- COMP.5610 Computer Security I\n- COMP.5620 Computer Security II\n- COMP.5630 Data Communications I\n- COMP.5640 Data Communications II\n- COMP.5490 Mobile Robots\n- COMP.5150 Operating Systems I\n- COMP.5160 Operating Systems II\n- COMP.5480 Robot Design\n- COMP.5230 Software Engineering I\n- COMP.5240 Software Engineering II\n\n## ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING\n\n- EECE.5280 Alternative Energy Sources\n- EECE.5060 Antenna Theory and Design\n- EECE.5320 Computational Electromagnetics\n- EECE.5130 Control Systems\n- EECE.5290 Electric Vehicle Technology\n- EECE.5070 Electromagnetic Waves and Materials\n- EECE.5120 Electronic Materials\n- EECE.5190 Engineering of Submicron Machines\n- EECE.5900 Fiber Optic Communications and Networks\n- EECE.5430 Introduction to Communication Theory\n- EECE.5090 Linear System Analysis\n- EECE.5050 Microwave Electronics\n- EECE.5330 Microwave Engineering\n- EECE.5150 Power Electronics\n- EECE.5840 Probability and Random Processes\n- EECE.5710 Radar Systems\n- EECE.5170 MMIC Design and Fabrication\n\n## MATERIALS ENGINEERING\n\n- PLAS.5440 Advanced Plastics Materials\n- CHEN.5060 Interfacial Science and Engineering and Colloids\n- CHEN.5070 Material Science and Engineering\n- PLAS.5030 Mechanical Behavior of Polymers\n- CHEN.5230 Nanodevices and Electronic Materials\n- CHEN.5270 Nanomaterials Science and Engineering\n- CHEN.5410 Nanostructural Characterization by SEM, TEM, and AFM\n- PLAS.5180 Plastics Product Design\n\n## MECHANICAL ENGINEERING\n\n- MECH.5120 Applied Finite Element Analysis\n- MECH.5710 Concurrent Engineering and Quality\n- MECH.5230 Cooling of Electronic Equipment\n- MECH.5740 Design for Reliability Engineering\n- MECH.5160 Experimental Modal Analysis\n- MECH.5240 Fundamentals of Acoustics\n- MECH.5750 Industrial Design of Experiments\n- MECH.5730 Manufacturing Systems Engineering\n- MECH.5910 Mechanical Behavior of Materials\n- MECH.5150 Modal Analysis- Theoretical Methods\n- MECH.5790 Robotics\n- MECH.5620 Solid Mechanics\n- MECH.5270 Solar Systems Engineering\n- MECH.5500 Vibrations\n\n## Nanotechnology7\n\nCivil & Environmental, Mechanical, Plastics Engineering departments\n\nContact:Jackie Zhang978-934-2287Jackie_Zhang@uml.edu\n\nThe program will provide students with a fundamental knowledge of nanotechnology and is intended to respond to the increasing demand for trained professionals in nanoscience and technology.

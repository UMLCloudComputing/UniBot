Special information is provided in the following sections concerning required aptitude examinations for applicants to music programs,\u00a0portfolio requirements for art majors and for satisfaction of department language requirements through the Foreign Language Achievement Tests of the College Entrance Examination Board.\n\nUMass Lowell does offer a No Test Option for students who do not feel as if their standardized test scores are an accurate reflection of their ability to be successful in a university setting. Applicants who scored an 1120 or higher on the SAT, or 23 or higher on the ACT, are good candidates to submit standardized test scores as part of the application process.\n\nApplicants applying under the No Test Option should have a recommended minimum GPA of 3.250 or higher and evidence of outstanding academic success throughout high school.\n\nThe responsibility for having all credentials forwarded to the University of Massachusetts Lowell rests solely with the applicant.\u00a0A student\u2019s admission is contingent upon receipt of official notification of successful completion of high school graduation requirements.\n\nAdmission Requirements for Graduating High School Seniors and High School Graduates\n\nThe general expectation is that applicants will present course work, which has been taken within college preparatory curricula. However, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions will evaluate the academic units of vocational technical school (Chapter 74) graduates to determine their relevance for University curricula. The ultimate judgment concerning such equivalency rests solely with the University of Massachusetts Lowell. The following pages specify prescribed high school unit requirements and other qualitative requirements for the admission of freshmen students. Applicants must satisfactorily complete prescribed units prior to enrollment. Table 1 specifies the high school unit distribution which is required for general University admission consideration.\n\nPrescribed High School Unit Requirements\n\nTable 1: General University Admission\n\n<table cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 100%;\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 25%;\" width=\"25%\"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><th align=\"left\" class=\"\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Subject Required</strong></th><th align=\"left\" class=\"\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Units</strong></th></tr><tr><td>English</td><td>4 courses</td></tr><tr><td>Mathematics</td><td>4 courses (Algebra I &amp; II, Geometry or Trigonometry, Precalculus or Calculus or comparable coursework)</td></tr><tr><td>Sciences</td><td>3 courses (including 3 courses with laboratory work)</td></tr><tr><td>Social Sciences</td><td>2 courses (including 1 course in U.S. History)</td></tr><tr><td>Foreign Languages</td><td>2 courses (in a single language)</td></tr><tr><td>Electives</td><td>2 courses (from the above subjects or from the Arts and Humanities or Computer Sciences)</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\nMinimum Prescribed Units 17\n\nQualitative Requirements for the Admission of Freshman Students\n\nAll freshman applicants are evaluated using standards determined by both the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education and the University. Emphasis is placed upon the rigor of the high school course selection as well as scores on standardized tests (if applicable); letters of recommendation, essays and extracurricular activities are also considered during the evaluation of applications.\n\nEntering freshmen in Fall 2022 had an average GPA of 3.670 and an average combined Critical Reading and Math SAT score of 1257 (ACT equivalent 28).\n\nAdmissions Standards\n\nAll applicants are evaluated using standards determined by both theMassachusetts Department of Higher Educationand the university. Each new admissions cycle, these standards are proposed by the Dean of Enrollment and the Director of Undergraduate Admissions with final approval made by the Provost. Admissions standards are based on admission and yield rates of the previous fall\u2019s incoming freshman class, retention rates of the previous fall\u2019s incoming freshman class and overall university enrollment goals.\n\nAdmissions counselors and policy makers are sensitive to the factors that may result in accomplished students having a lower-than-expected GPA or SAT/ACT score. The applications of students who do not meet the standards, but who demonstrate the potential to be successful at UMass Lowell, are reviewed on a case by case basis.\n\nEnglish Language Learners\n\nAn English language learner, or limited English proficient student, is defined as a student who does not speak English (or whose native language is not English) and is not currently able to perform ordinary classroom work in English, or a student who was identified as an English language learner or limited English proficient student at any point during their high school career. Students who were English language learners during high school must complete all required high school level academic courses with two exceptions:\n\nStudents who do not meet the DHE exceptions may be reviewed by the English Proficiency Committee to determine ability to succeed in the classroom. The EPC considers essays, letters of recommendation, general coursework, and grades to determine proficiency. Students can be admitted through this committee or the committee can recommend students complete TOEFL, IELTS, Pearson Versant, Duolingo, or the UMass Lowell English Proficiency exam to determine proficiency in English.\n\nMusic Aptitude and Proficiency Examinations, College of Fine Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences\n\nStudents who wish to apply for music programs are required to demonstrate vocal or instrumental ability in a performance audition with a member of the faculty of the College of Fine Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences. In addition to prepared audition materials, applicants will take a diagnostic theory exam. This exam will not be factored into acceptance into the major. Performance auditions and theory testing are scheduled throughout the spring semester. Applicants will be invited to take these special music tests at the university when all credentials have been evaluated by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and the applicant has applied to the university.\n\nArt Portfolio Requirements, College of Fine Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences\n\nStudents who wish to apply for the university\u2019s art and design programs are required to demonstrate a student\u2019s independent thought and the diversity of their experience in visual arts. The portfolio should consist of 10 original works of art. The portfolio must be submitted through Slideroom as part of an applicant\u2019s supporting document.\n\n## Quick Links\n\n- Request Information\n- Apply\n- Check Application Status\n- Visit\n\n"

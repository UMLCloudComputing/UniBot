Applicants must submit official transcripts of all prior undergraduate and graduate courses. Each applicant must submit an official report of Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test scores, as well as three letters of recommendation. The TOEFL exam is required for students from abroad whose native language is not English.\u00a0 Applicants must meet allGraduate Admissions standardsfor this program.\n\n## PLANPlan of Study\n\nEach student entering the program must develop a plan of study in consultation with his/her advisor.\n\nVisit theECE Graduate Website.\n\n## Transfer Credit\n\ni.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Student\u2019s previous institution must send student\u2019s official transcript to UML Registrar through an email (registrar@uml.edu).The official transcript should only be send by the previous institution directly to UML\u2019s Registrar.\n\nii.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Course Transfer petition form filled out completely and signed/dated (student to submit to the Associate Chair for the Doctoral Program),\n\niii.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Unofficial transcript from the past institution that you are trying to transfer credit from (student to submit to the Associate Chair for the Doctoral Program),\n\niv.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information on the accreditation (ABET or similar) for your department/institution (student to submit to the Associate Chair for the Doctoral Program),\n\nv.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Course description, credit and course number for each course being intended to transfer (student to submit to the Associate Chair for the Doctoral Program).\n\nvi.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Associate Chair for the Doctoral Program) will evaluate and approve the courses that can be transferred, and will make a request to the Associate Dean to do a final evaluation and approval. Dean\u2019s office requests registrar to complete the course transfer process.\n\nCourse transfers arenot allowed for the BS to PhD program. In other words, students who are admitted into our PhD program student directly after completing their BS degrees cannot transfer any MS/PhD level technical elective courses they have taken as part of their BS degree pathway or for their minor. However, those courses may be transferred into the MS program, if student choses to do MS first.\n\n## ECE DEPARTMENTece-department-qualifier-examQUALIFIER EXAM\n\nThe Qualifier Exam (QE) consists of three parts: i) course requirement; ii) oral presentation on a selected topic; and iii) written documentation on the same topic. Please see details below.\n\nQualifier Exam Committee\n\nThe QE Committee consists of three ECE faculty. One member is the faculty advisor. An additional member is selected by the student and the advisor. The 3rd member will be assigned by the ECE Qualifier Exam Sub-Committee (QESC**) and can be from ECE or non-ECE Dept. Selection of a non-ECE member shall be made only with the approval of the student\u2019s advisor.\u00a0 If the student of a QESC member will be taking the exam, he/she must recuse themselves from the QESC for their student\u2019s exam. To allow sufficient time for the QESC to add the 3rd member, the ECE Request for Approval of PhD Qualifying Examination Committee form must be submitted to the graduate program coordinator at least one month prior to the anticipated QE date. The Chair of the committee can be either the advisor/student selected committee member or the third member, at the committee's discretion. A fourth member can be added at the discretion of the advisor.\n\n** The QESC will be comprised of 7 members: 6 elected plus the Doctoral coordinator. Yearly elections will be held for the 6 members from the ECE Faculty.\n\nQualifier Exam Course Requirements\n\nThe student must complete two graduate ECE courses in their primary research area and one additional graduate ECE core course by the term the QE is scheduled. One of the three required courses may be taken during the semester when the QE is administered. The student must receive an average GPA of at least 3.300 for these courses.\n\nFailure to do so will be considered a failed attempt.\n\nQualifier Exam Policies and Procedures:\n\n\u2022 The purpose of the Qualifier Exam (QE) is to test the fundamental knowledge acquired by the student over prior coursework and assess the ability to apply this fundamental knowledge to approach research questions/problems.\n\n\u2022 The student must take the qualifier exam within the first 3 semesters of their entrance into the doctoral program. If taken in the Fall semester, the exam must be administered by mid-November and by mid-April in the Spring semester. If the student fails, then an advisor-led appeal may be submitted to the QESC and if approved, must be scheduled for a date within the following semester of the failed attempt. If the appeal is not approved, then the student fails and is no longer in the PhD program.\n\nIf the appeal is granted, the QE committee remains the same for the second attempt. If the advisor changes between the first and second attempts (if appeal is approved), the two other committee members remain the same. If a student fails the second time (if appeal is granted) the student is no longer in the PhD program.\n\nIf the student does not take the QE during the semester he/she is required to take it, this will be considered a failed attempt. Any extenuating circumstances may be brought up to the QESC by the advisor.\n\nQualifier Exam Format:\n\ni. ORAL COMPONENT:\n\nThe exam will be 90 minutes long. The student will be asked to give a short presentation (20-30 minutes) on a research topic chosen by the advisor and the student.This research topic should be submitted to the QESC within the first semester of the student\u2019s entrance into the program to make sure that the student progress is on a timeline.\u00a0 The presentation will be a literature survey of the particular topic based on recent (<5 years) high impact publications. It cannot be a conference paper submitted by the student AND it cannot have any author other than the student taking the exam.\n\nThe presentation will be followed by questioning by each member (including advisor) on: (a) directly about the research topic presented (as would be typical at a conference), and (b) in the general area of the research topic (to test the student's grasp of the problem area) and will be on fundamentals testing the student's ability to integrate the material learned in the courses they took, the ability to apply their knowledge to solve research problems; and these questions do not have to be associated with the presentation. The student will supply 3 undergraduate courses most aligned with their research topic they are presenting when they submit their QE registration form.\n\nIt is expected that the student answers the questions on their own without the assistance of the advisor. The advisor should not assist the student in preparation of the presentation and the paper (see below)\n\nii. WRITTEN COMPONENT:\n\nAt least one week prior to the oral presentation, the student will provide a four-page two-column document, in the standard format for conferences in their area, to all committee members. This work will be solely the work of the student and the student should be the only author. It is important that\u00a0 the student does not plagiarize (plagiarizing can be defined as \"taking the work or an idea of someone else and passing it off as one's own\"). If there are any questions on this, please consult your advisor or the doctoral coordinator.\n\nThis write-up will be a written version of the oral presentation. The student will also provide a copy of this document to the ECE Qual Exam Subcommittee ahead of the exam date. The quality of the written component is expected to be ready for submission and should be clear, well organized, and free of spelling and grammar errors. The advisor should not assist the student in preparation of the paper - it should be independent work. The paper cannot be a conference paper or journal publication the student has prepared and there should only be ONE author (the student who is taking the qualifying exam).\n\niii. RESULTS:\n\nWhen the committee is finished asking questions, the committee members will meet in closed session to discuss and vote on whether the student passed the oral exam. During the exam, there will be a form filled out by the committee members which will be used to discuss the results of the exam. The student is considered to have passed the oral exam with a unanimous vote from the committee.\n\nIf the decision is not unanimous, then the following procedure will be followed:\n\ni.The person or persons who do not agree with the decision to pass the student will write a detailed reason for why they believe they do not agree and present to the QE Subcommittee. The QESC will then make a decision.ii.If a unanimous vote is not obtained as a result of the QESC decision, and the student is deemed to fail the exam, then advisor can appeal for a second chance as written above.\n\nCANDIDACYCandidacy Requirements\n\nAt least two weeks (14 days) prior to the date of the presentation of the dissertation proposal AND the final defense, an announcement document must be submitted to the Associate Chair for the Doctoral Program and the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies in the College of Engineering. After the committee members and the posting is approved by the Associate Dean for Graduate studies, posting will be forwarded to the UML News by the Dean\u2019s Office. The template for posting thesis and dissertation announcement can be found at defense announcement template.\n\nThe dissertation proposal is open to the public. The proposal will outline the motivation for the research, give a summary of the related past work in the area and present the scope of the proposed dissertation research. The proposal should clearly articulate the proposed contribution of the student to the knowledge base and how it differs from the past work. The examinee will be expected to answer questions from the audience to demonstrate his/her understanding of the proposed research, as well as his/her proficiency in the general research field related to the dissertation proposal. The dissertation committee may require the candidate to retake the proposal defense after additional work.\n\nThe final defense entails a PhD student defending their doctoral dissertation and is expected to utilize the same committee that was put together by the advisor for the dissertation proposal defense. Any changes to the committee must be approved by the Associate Chair for the Doctoral Program. Upon a successful presentation and submission of a high quality doctoral dissertation students will become eligible to graduate if they have completed all of the required credits (course, dissertation and seminar credits). Student must file a Declaration of Intent to Graduate Form (pdf) (aka DIG form) with the Registrar's Office. Deadlines can be found on the University\u2019s Academic Calendar. The Registrar's Office will verify course credit, grade and GPA requirements, and submission of dissertation prior to the awarding the degree.\n\nAcademic Requirements\n\n1.

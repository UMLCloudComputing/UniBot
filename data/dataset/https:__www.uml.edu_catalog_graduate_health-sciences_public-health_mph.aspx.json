Dietetics and Social and Behavioral Sciences. The program accepts both full and part-time students and provides students with knowledge essential to the practice of public health on a global scale. Students develop a strong foundation in public health by studying environmental health issues, epidemiology and biostatistics, public health policy, public health leadership and management, and social and behavioral determinants of health, as well as study in specialization areas so that graduates gain the expertise necessary to address some of the world\u2019s most pressing problems.\n\nGraduates of the MPH program will:\n\n- Analyze public health data and apply evidence-based practices to public health issues.\n- Use cutting-edge technology and practice to find ways to equitably and efficiently provide the best quality health care to the largest amount of people.\n- Address current public health challenges through multidisciplinary approaches that apply the latest scientific knowledge, collaboration, and creative problem-solving skills.\n\n## AdmissionRequirementsAdmission Requirementsadmission-requirements\n\n- An application completed online at www.uml.edu/grad/\n- Transcripts from a completed BA or BS degree in any field, or senior-year status, with an overall GPA of at least 3.000.\n- Grades of C or better in required, prerequisite college-level courses. These include a minimum one semester of statistics and one semester of either biology or anatomy and physiology. Applicants who are missing prerequisites may be admitted with the provision that they meet with their advisor before or during their first semester and develop a plan of study to complete the prerequisites during the first year.\n- Applicants to the Dietetics option must earn grades of B- or better in the following college level pre-requisite courses: Human Nutrition, Microbiology, Food Science, Medical Nutrition Therapy I and II, Nutrition and Metabolism, Biochemistry, Organic Chemistry, Statistics, Biology or Anatomy and Physiology, and Psychology or Sociology or Anthropology.\n- Two Letters of recommendation from individuals able to judge an applicant's readiness for graduate study.\n- A statement of purpose, typically a 1-2 page document providing information about the applicant's future plans, a description of how the MPH degree fits into these plans and evidence of an applicant's readiness for graduate study.\n- GRE scores are NOT required for Master of Public Health program applications.\n\n## For International Applicants\n\n- English proficiency testing including one of the following:\nTOEFL minimum 79IELTS minimum 6.5Duolingo minimum 115\n- TOEFL minimum 79\n- IELTS minimum 6.5\n- Duolingo minimum 115\n- Transcripts from colleges outside the United States must be certified by a credentialing agency such as WES (www.wes.org) or CED (www.cedevaluations.com).

Epidemiology and the closely related field of biostatistics are core disciplines of public health and there continues to be a strong need for MPH professionals with expertise in these field for both public an private health programs. The goal of this specialization is to produce practitioners who have a solid grasp of the fundamental principles of epidemiology and health statistics including study design, data analysis, assessment of bias, control of confounders and exposure assessment.\n\nEpidemiology field experience will be provided through the practicum experience with public and private sector health agencies. Examples include collaborations with the Massachusetts and New Hampshire Departments of Public Health, town and city health department, regional health departments, and regional hospitals.\n\n- Degree Pathway\n- Program Outcomes\n\n## SocialMPH in Social & Behavioral Sciences\n\nHealth Promotion is the process of applying social and behavioral science principles to education and environmental change that empowers individuals and groups to take control of and improve their own health. MPH Specialists combine knowledge of social and behavioral sciences to create and carry out successful public health interventions to promote population health. The goal of this option is to educate practitioners who have a broad foundation of the fundamental principles of public heath with a focus on program planning and evaluation.\n\nThe 6-credit MPH practicum provides students focusing on Social and Behavioral Sciences with applied experience in health promotion and disease prevention. Examples include collaborations in planning, implementing and evaluating public health campaigns at federal agencies, state and local health departments, hospital settings, community health centers, social service agencies and non-profit public health organizations.\n\n- Degree Pathway\n- Program Outcomes\n\n## HealthcareMPH in Healthcare Management\n\nAt the local, regional and national level, our healthcare system confronts new challenges in coping with the many changes in technology, information systems, financing and management. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, \"Employment of medical and health services managers is expected to grow 32% from 2019 to 2029, much faster than the average for all occupations\". The MPH concentration in Healthcare Management will prepare graduates to manage public health programs and organizations. Students will learn the conceptual, organizational, personnel and financial skills required for effective, but also compassionate and ethical, work performance.\n\nGraduates with a MPH in Healthcare Management will have advanced education in healthcare finance, quantitative methods, operations analysis and quality improvement, healthcare economics and healthcare information systems. They will be prepared to assume leadership positions in for-profit and non-profit public health and healthcare organizations.\n\n- Degree Pathway\n- Program Outcomes\n\n\n\n## Quick Links\n\n- Request Information\n- Apply\n- Check Application Status\n- Visit\n\n"

Students can choose to focus on courses in cellular, organismal, ecological, evolutionary, molecular, and physiological biology. Depending on their career goals, students may choose either course work or research options. All MS candidates are expected to show sufficient knowledge and skills to pursue independent and creative research.\n\nTheMaster of Science in Biological Sciences - Bioinformatics Optionprepares students for industry positions in bioinformatics and computational biology by providing interdisciplinary coursework in Biology and other science disciplines which emphasize the biologically-informed analysis and interpretation of biological data. Thus students gain the skills necessary for the analysis of biological datasets, and the opportunity to engage in research experiences that require the application and development of computational analysis to solve biological problems. This option is focused on bioinformatics through a biologically informed lens.\n\nThe Master of Science in Biological Sciences, and theMaster of Science in Biological Sciences - Biotechnology Optionprovide the advanced study and training necessary to conduct independent research at a professional level and to be successful in today's competitive academic and industrial research markets. Students in the program will be encouraged to explore quantitative approaches to the solution of problems in the basic and applied biological sciences. Depending on their career goals, students may choose either research or course work options within the Department, or from either the Bioinformatics or the interdisciplinary Biotechnology option. All candidates for the master's degree are expected to demonstrate sufficient knowledge and skills to pursue independent and creative research activities.\n\nGraduates of theMaster of Science in Biological Sciences: Education, Communication and Outreachoption will gain expertise in the biological sciences, while also taking appropriate coursework in education, psychology, and business that is tailored to their desired career. This program would be a great fit for students with career interests in education, curriculum development, as well as life science and sustainability training. Students selecting from this option would have a choice of completing coursework only, or coursework with a project of theses; a project or thesis could be in biology education depending on future career plans.\n\n\n\n## Admissions Requirements\n\nApplications for the Master of Science, including the Bioinformatics, Biotechnology and Education, Communication and Outreach Options, are considered twice per year, with deadlines for receipt of applications of Oct. 15 and Jan. 10 for the following Spring and Fall semesters, respectively.\u00a0Students are encouraged to apply before the regular application deadline for full consideration; however, applications received after the deadline will be considered on a rolling basis.\n\nEntering graduate students are expected to have sound preparation in the biological sciences, chemistry, physics, calculus, and statistics. A student found deficient in any of these areas may be required, during the first year, to take appropriate courses to eliminate the deficiencies. If the student has not had a biochemistry course,BIOL.5190should be taken for graduate credit. The departmental Graduate Coordinator helps plan the entering students' programs of study, acquaints them with research opportunities in the department, and assists in selecting research advisors.\n\nApplications and information for admission to the MS program can be found on theGraduate Admissions website.\n\n## Degree Requirements\n\nMinimal core requirements for all options include 1 semester (3 credits) of Professional Communication in Science and TechnologyBIOL.6040, a graduate colloquium -BIOL.6010(1 credit)\u00a0and a minimum of 12 credits of formal course work selected from departmental electives (exclusive of thesis, project, problems, or other directed studies).\n\nThe remaining credits may be satisfied by additional electives within the department (thesis, project, problems, or more course work), by transfer credit for approved graduate level biological sciences courses taken at other accredited institutions (9 credit maximum), or by graduate courses taken in related disciplines within the University (e.g., bioinformatics, chemistry, environmental sciences, chemical engineering, radiological sciences; 8 credit maximum). There is no formal language requirement.\n\nStudents whose professional goals are to continue on for the Ph.D. degree, or who plan to seek employment in academic or industrial research laboratories as technicians or junior scientists are strongly advised to choose the thesis or project option in order to successfully compete for such positions. Students in the non-thesis option should endeavor to select courses with accompanying laboratories whenever possible.\n\n## Thesis:\n\nIn choosing to complete a thesis, the student concentrates on an in-depth, independent, scholarly investigation of a contemporary biological problem. Credit is allowed for 6-12 semester hours of M.S. Thesis Research. After consulting with the research advisor, the student selects two additional faculty members (one of whom must be from within the Department) to serve as members of the Thesis Committee. The student presents to the Committee a proposal of intended research and obtains the Committee's approval of the research topic. After completing the written thesis, the student gives an oral presentation of his results to the Thesis Committee.\n\n## Project:\n\nThe project track is designed for independent laboratory investigations of a more limited nature than completing a thesis. Generally, a project is completed in one or two semesters and credit is given for 3 or 6 semester hours of M.S. Project (no more than 6 credits will be allowed).\n\n## Non-Thesis:\n\nThis track offers course work in breadth and depth, and may be of special interest to secondary school science teachers and individuals already employed in academic, hospital, or industrial laboratories. The course work only track may be completed during the day on a full-time basis or in late-afternoon or evening sessions on a part-time basis. However, since not all day courses are available in the evening sessions, a part-time student's progress toward the M.S. degree will depend not only on his/her available time and abilities, but also on the scheduling of electives. In some instances, with the consent of a faculty member, an evening student may elect to complete a thesis or project.\n\n## Professional Experience:\n\nCredit (BIOL-5000; 3cr) may be requested by individuals who present satisfactory evidence (in the form of a written statement from their current supervisor) of engaging in at least one year of full-time experience in secondary school science teaching, or in an academic, hospital, or industrial laboratory setting.\n\n## Professional Communication in Science and Technology\n\nEach student is required to complete one semester of Professional Communication in Science and Technology (BIOL.6040; 3 credits) in Biology.\n\n## Master of Science in Biological Sciences -generalGeneral\n\n- Degree Pathway\n\n## Master of Science in Biological Sciences -bioinformaticsBioinformatics Option\n\n- Degree Pathway\n\n## Master of Science in Biological Sciences - Biotechnology OptionFour\n\nThis option is more structured than the M.S. in Biological Sciences program described above. The core curriculum offers extensive hands-on experience in current techniques and instrumentation. Field trips and seminars afford students an opportunity for interaction with the biotechnology industry. Students are encouraged to conduct research in one of the recognized areas of biotechnology or to present an innovative application of technology or engineering principles to a biological problem of economic interest. The nature and extent of the investigation will determine its degree credit value. Those who enter the program having already completed some of the core courses, or who already have extensive laboratory experience, may consult with an advisor to design a course of study appropriate to their needs. A variety of biotechnology-related electives are available.\n\n- Degree Pathway\n\n## Master of Science in Biological Sciences:EducationEducation, Communication and Outreach Option\n\nThis 33 credit program allows students to gain expertise in the biological sciences, while also taking appropriate coursework in education, psychology, and business that is tailored to their desired career. Students have the opportunity to diversify their coursework into other departments that are relevant for their career paths, without compromising the scientific rigor or their education and training.\n\nGraduates of the Master of Science in Biological Sciences: Education, Communication and Outreach option will be prepared to:\n\n- Communicate biological and related scientific concepts to the public, students and/or their colleagues.\n- Effectively communicate using evidence-based approaches, i.e., using active learning, eliciting misconceptions, and supporting constructivist learning.\n- Support science-informed decision-making for experts in other areas.\n- Interpret, analyze and evaluate evidence-based education research.\n- Apply knowledge of biological sciences to the understanding of peer-reviewed research.\n\n## Quick Links\n\n- Request Information\n- Apply\n- Check Application Status\n- Visit\n\n"

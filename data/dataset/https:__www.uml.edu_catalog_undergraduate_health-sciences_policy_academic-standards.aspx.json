Such students may seek reinstatement to programs by filing a petition with the professional review committee of their respective departments. Students who are granted a probationary period must maintain all program criteria for remainder of time in their major. Failure to do so will result in dismissal from the program. Students whose petitions for reinstatement are denied may seek transfer to another major within the university if they qualify under university policies. Students who do not qualify for another major may be dismissed from the university at the time they are dismissed from the Zuckerberg College of Health Sciences.\n\n## Quick Links\n\n- Request Information\n- Apply\n- Check Application Status\n- Visit\n\n"

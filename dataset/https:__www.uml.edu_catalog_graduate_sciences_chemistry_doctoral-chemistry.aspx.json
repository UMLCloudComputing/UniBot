The plan of study pursued by each student is dependent on individual requirements and is developed through a conference with the Advisory Committee (or with his or her temporary advisor). The initial part of the student's program, normally completed at the end of two years of study, is devoted to formal course work. The first year is usually given to subjects in the major branches of chemistry in preparation for area (candidacy) examinations. The second year is devoted primarily to advanced subjects in a special field of concentration. The second and final part of the program is devoted principally to research leading to the doctoral thesis. However, the student is encouraged to begin research as early as possible in the program of study.\n\nResearch Tools RequirementsThese research tools may be a second foreign language, a computer language, a statistics course or another skill acceptable to both the Graduate Coordinator and the research advisor of the student. The language(s) selected may not include the native language of a student's country of origin. Students in all Ph.D. programs may fulfill this requirement by 1) two foreign language courses; 2) one foreign language and a research skill course or 3) two research skill courses. The Language Requirement may be met by completion of a two-semester undergraduate course sequence in French, German, Japanese or Russian with an average grade of B or better. The Research skill requirement may be met by taking courses in programming and/or Statistics.\n\nCredit RequirementsOf the 45 minimum credit requirements, a minimum of 27 credits in course work, exclusive of thesis and seminar, is required with at least 18 to be taken in chemistry. The remaining course credits (9 or more, with a student's Advisory Committee having the authority to add 6 additional credits to the minimum in special situations) may be taken in chemistry or in a related field such as biology, physics, mathematics or engineering. Credit is not normally allowed for undergraduate subjects in chemistry except for those so designated in the catalog. Research credits would then make up the remainder of the 45 credit requirements. Planning the program of courses with the student is the responsibility of a student's Advisory Committee.\n\nCourse RequirementsEach student in any of the Ph.D. programs in Chemistry shall take both an advanced course in Physical Chemistry and Organic Chemistry and two courses from Advanced Inorganic, Advanced Analytical, Biochemistry, or Polymer Chemistry unless such requirements have been met previously. Since each division (Analytical, Biochemistry, Organic and Physical) has its own specific course requirements, a student intending to specialize in one of these areas is encouraged to meet with the coordinator of that program.\n\nA.

The method of conducting these area exams is designated by the staff in each field of specialization, as follows:\n\nACAnalytical ChemistryThe area examinations for analytical chemistry will consist of a series of six (6) examinations. The first will be a qualifying examination used to test the student\u2019s general knowledge of Analytical Chemistry. The student will have two opportunities to pass the qualifying examination with a score of 5.0 out of 10.0 points This qualifying exam will be administered at the beginning and end of the area exams. The area examinations will be offered annually, commencing in October and administered at monthly intervals. A minimum of 6.0 out of a possible 10.0 points is required for each individual examination and a total of at least 30.0 out of a possible 50.0 points is required for the successful completion of the Written Area Examination. Failure to perform adequately may resulting the student being required to complete a master's degree. Continuation towards the Ph.D. degree will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\nOCOrganic ChemistryOrganic students take comprehensive examination consisting of consist of a written and an oral component, taken at the beginning of the second academic year of study (third semester). The exam will focus on the student's own research. The written document should include the following sections: abstract, comprehensive literature review, experimental design and methods, results to date, future plans, and references, following the style and format of ACS publications. The \u00a0oral exam will consist of a presentation by the student, followed by examination by the committee members. The questions raised by the committee members can be related to the student's research, and can also be general chemistry and organic chemistry knowledge that are expected from the student. the oral exam is closed to the public. The student must pass both the written and the oral parts of the cumulative examinations in order to advance to the Ph.D candidacy.\n\nPCPhysical ChemistryBy the third year of graduate study, a Ph.D. student in physical chemistry must take a comprehensive examination. This is an all day written examination with questions designed to test the student's physical chemistry background, and ability to set up models and solve them mathematically. The student has two chances to pass the comprehensive examination.\n\nResearch ProposalRPAs part of the area examination(s) a Ph.D. candidate must present an oral defense of an original research proposal within 3 months of completing the written area examinations although a specific program may require the proposal to be presented at an earlier date. With the aid and advice of the Advisory Committee the student selects a suitable subject for investigation, completes a literature survey, outlines the method of approach, and suggests possible results and conclusions. The oral defense of this proposal is conducted by the student's Advisory Committee with other faculty members in attendance. The proposal is defended by the end of the semester following completion of area exams. The topic of the proposal cannot be closely related to or contained within the thesis project.\n\nChemistry SeminarDuring each year of residence the student is required to attend and participate inCHEM.6010,6020, Chemistry Seminar, andCHEM.6030,6040, Chemistry Colloquium. Each doctoral student is required to present two seminars.\n\nCandidacy for the Doctorate in ChemistryTo be admitted to candidacy for the doctorate, a student must:\n\n## InterdisciplinaryPh.D. Option in Biochemistry\n\nThis program provides chemistry graduate students with both in-breadth class work in BioChemistry and in-depth thesis research.

The student is required to present two one-hour presentations during his/her residence.\n\nResearch\n\nA. Initiation of Research and Research Advisor Selection ProcedureThe dissertation research of each graduate student may be initiated at any time but not later than the end of the second semester in the program. The student is advised to make serious efforts, prior to the summer following his/her first entrance to the program, to initiate faculty research interviews and attempt to identify the area of his/her research interest and particular research group which may be suitable for pursuing his/her research goals.\n\nB. Examination CommitteeThe examination committee will be composed of four faculty members chosen after consultation by the student with his/her research advisor at least two of these members must be from the Department of Chemistry faculty.\n\nExaminationsA. Comprehensive ExamStudents are required to successfully complete a Comprehensive Exam based on the 5 core courses by the end of their second year in the program. This exam consists of two parts and students are expected to have satisfactory performance on both sections. Section I consists of a series of questions derived from their course material. Section II is based on current literature and is focused on a particular series of papers that are provided to the students a month before the exam.\n\nB. Oral Research Proposalmust be presented during their 5th semester. This proposal based on their dissertation work and is to follow the format outlined in the proposal guidelines. A written copy of the proposal must be submitted to their dissertation committee one week prior to their public examination. Examination committees for the ORP consist of four full-time faculty or professionals. Two members of the committee must be members of the Chemistry department and the other two members of the committee must have a Ph.D. in Biochemistry or the equivalent. Successful completion of the Original Research Proposal defense will advance students to candidacy in the Biochemistry Ph.D. Program. Students will have two opportunities to complete this exam. IF the the combination of the written and oral presentation is not at the level of a Ph.D. candidate, as judged by the committee, a student will be provided a second opportunity to satisfactorily complete the exam. At the committee's discretion, a student may be asked to only repeat the written or oral portion of the exam. This must be done by the student's sixth semester or they will not be advanced to Ph.D. candidacy.\n\nAdmission to Candidacy for the DoctorateTo be admitted to candidacy for the doctorate, a student must:\n\n## Environmental-StudiesPh.D. Option in Environmental Studies\n\nThis graduate program is designed as an optional course of study to the traditional Ph.D. in Chemistry for students with backgrounds in engineering (civil, environmental and chemical engineering) and other sciences (physics, biology, etc.) as well as chemistry. Candidates will be exposed to advanced course work in chemistry and environmental engineering and will be able to choose an area of specialization that best suits their interests and previous experience. A combination of faculty from Chemistry, Work Environment and Civil Engineering with a variety of research expertise gives this program unique characteristics and affords the student the opportunity to perform practical interdisciplinary research. It is expected that most students will require at least four years beyond the Bachelor's degree and two years past the Master's degree.\n\nEntrance RequirementsIn addition to the requirements for admission listed in this catalog, applicant will have an earned bachelor's degree in one of the following fields: chemistry, chemical or civil engineering, biology, environmental sciences, geology or physics. Students will be expected to have satisfactorily completed undergraduate courses in analytical, organic, and physical chemistry, physics and calculus. However, applicants who have not completed courses in these areas may remedy their deficiencies while in the program and, therefore, are encouraged to apply. The GRE is no longer required. Admissions will be determined by a committee consisting of faculty active in the program.\n\nProgram OutlineA total of 48 credits are required for the Ph.D. program. Of these, at least 30 credits must be in course work exclusive of seminar and the rest is usually in thesis research. Courses shown below are divided into three categories:\n\n- core course requirements (9 credits),\n- areas of specialization (12 credits), and\n- elective courses (9 credits).\n\nAdditional elective courses from other departments may be substituted with the approval of the student's Advisory Committee.\n\nIn addition, full-time students must register forCHEM.601/CHEM.602orENVE.502Environmental/Analytical seminar every semester.\n\nEach student will be required to give two seminars on current research topics during their graduate career. Students in the Environmental program must select a thesis advisor by the end of the second semester. At this time, an Advisory Committee is appointed and a plan of study is established. The Advisory Committee must consist of at least four members, including the thesis advisor. A minimum of two Chemistry Department faculty are required to be on the committee with two other members from any participating department. An additional member from another department may also be added if agreed upon by the student and thesis advisor. Students must maintain a 3.000 cumulative average in order to continue in the program.\n\nRequired Courses (21 credits):\n\nI.

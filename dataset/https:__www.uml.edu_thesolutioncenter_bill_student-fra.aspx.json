    "text": "# Student Financial Responsibility Agreement (FRA) | The Solution Center | UMass Lowell\n\n## Student Financial Responsibility Agreement (FRA)\n\n## University of Massachusetts Lowell Student Financial Agreement\n\nI fully understand and agree that my authorization to enroll and continue to register for courses at the University of Massachusetts Lowell is expressly conditioned on my acceptance of the terms and conditions of this agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) set forth below. In exchange for the opportunity to enroll at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, to receive educational services, and for other valuable consideration, I agree to the following terms and conditions.\n\n## Payment of Fees/Promise to Pay\n\nI understand and agree that when I register for any class or receive any service at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, I am agreeing to accept full responsibility to pay all tuition, fees and other associated costs assessed as a result of my registration and/or receipt of services. I further understand and agree that my registration and acceptance of these terms constitutes a promissory note agreement (i.e., a financial obligation in the form of an educational loan as defined by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code at 11 U.S.C. \u00a7523(a)(8)) in which the University of Massachusetts Lowell is providing me educational services, deferring some or all of my payment obligation for those services, and I promise to pay for all assessed tuition, fees and other associated costs by the published or assigned due date.\n\n## Financial Aid\n\nI understand that aid described as \u201cestimated\u201d on my Financial Aid Award does not represent actual or guaranteed payment but is an estimate of the aid I may receive if I meet all requirements stipulated by that aid program.\n\nI understand that my Financial Aid Award is contingent upon my continued enrollment and attendance in each class upon which my financial aid eligibility was calculated. If I drop any class before completion, I understand and agree that my financial aid eligibility may decrease and some or all of the financial aid awarded to me may be revoked. If some or all of my financial aid is revoked because I dropped or failed to attend class, I agree to repay all revoked aid that was disbursed to my account and resulted in a credit balance that was refunded to me.\n\nI agree to allow financial aid I receive to pay any and all charges assessed to my account at the University of Massachusetts Lowell such as tuition, fees, campus housing and meal plans, student health insurance, service fees, fines, bookstore charges, or any other amount, in accordance with the terms of the aid.\n\n## Withdrawal/Failure to Withdraw\n\nI understand and agree that if I drop or withdraw from some or all of the classes for which I register, I will be responsible for paying all or a portion of tuition and fees in accordance with the published tuition refund schedule available on theRefund Withdrawal Policy webpage.\n\nI have read the terms and conditions of the published tuition refund schedule and understand those terms are incorporated herein by reference. I further understand that my failure to attend class or receive a bill does not absolve me of my financial responsibility as described above.\n\n## Delinquent Account/Collection\n\nFinancial Hold: I understand and agree that if I fail to pay my student account bill or any monies due and owing the University of Massachusetts Lowell by the scheduled due date, the University of Massachusetts Lowell will place a financial hold on my student account, preventing me from registering for future classes or receiving my diploma.\n\nLate Payment Charge: : I understand and agree that if I fail to pay my student account bill or any monies due and owing the University of Massachusetts Lowell by the scheduled due date, the University of Massachusetts Lowell may assess late payment charge as noted under theFee Descriptions webpage, on the past due portion of my student account until my past due account is paid in full.\n\nCollection Agency Fees: I understand and agree that if I fail to pay my student account bill or any monies due and owing the University of Massachusetts Lowell by the scheduled due date, and fail to make acceptable payment arrangements to bring my account current, the University of Massachusetts Lowell may refer my delinquent account to a collection agency. I further understand that if the University of Massachusetts Lowell refers my student account balance to a third party for collections, a collection fee will be assessed and will be due in full at the time of the referral to the third party. The collection fee will be calculated at the maximum amount permitted by applicable law but not to exceed 33% of the amount outstanding. For purposes of this provision, the third party may be a debt collection company or an attorney. If a lawsuit is filed to recover an outstanding balance, I shall be responsible for any costs associated with the lawsuit such as court costs or other applicable costs. Finally, I understand that my delinquent account may be reported to one or more of the national credit bureaus, i.e. Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion.\n\n## Communication\n\nMethod of Communication: I understand and agree that the University of Massachusetts Lowell uses e-mail as an official method of communication with me, and that therefore I am responsible for reading the e-mails I receive from the University of Massachusetts Lowell to any email address I have on file, including my University of Massachusetts Lowell student email, on a timely basis.\n\nContact: I authorize the University of Massachusetts Lowell and its agents and contractors to contact me at my current and any future cellular phone number(s), email address(es) or wireless device(s) regarding my delinquent student account(s)/loan(s), any other debt I owe to the University of Massachusetts Lowell, or to receive general information from the University of Massachusetts Lowell. I authorize the University of Massachusetts Lowell and its agents and contractors to use automated telephone dialing equipment, artificial or pre-recorded voice or text messages, and personal calls and emails, in their efforts to contact me. Furthermore, I understand that I may withdraw my consent to call my cellular phone using automated telephone dialing equipment by submitting my request in writing to the Collections Manager (email:PastDueAccts@uml.edu) at the University of Massachusetts Lowell or in writing to the applicable contractor or agent contacting me on behalf of the University of Massachusetts Lowell.\n\nUpdating Contact Information: I understand and agree that I am responsible for keeping the University of Massachusetts Lowell records up to date with my current physical addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers by following the procedure on theUpdate My Information webpage.

This includes but is not limited to receiving billing information through my online student account as explained on theMy Bill webpage. I understand and agree that I am responsible for viewing and paying my student account by the scheduled due dates. My failure to view my online student account does not absolve me of any financial obligations owed under this Agreement.\n\n## Billing Errors\n\nI understand that administrative, clerical, or technical billing errors do not absolve me of my financial responsibility to pay the correct amount of tuition, fees and other associated financial obligations assessed as a result of my registration at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. Should I believe my account to have any billing errors, I agree to contact the University of Massachusetts Lowell in writing within sixty (60) days after noting the error.\n\n## Returned Payments / Failed Payment Agreements\n\nIf a payment made to my student account is returned by the bank for any reason, I agree to repay the original amount of the payment plus a returned payment fee as noted under the Returned Check Fee as explained on theFee Descriptions webpage.

I expressly consent to the jurisdiction of Suffolk County state courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and waive any claim or defense that such forum is not convenient or proper. This paragraph shall not be construed to limit any other legal rights of myself or the University of Massachusetts Lowell.\n\n## Severability\n\nIf any provision, term, or clause of this Agreement is declared illegal, unenforceable, or ineffective in a legal forum with competent jurisdiction to do so, this Agreement shall be deemed severable, and all other provisions, terms and clauses of the Agreement will remain valid and binding on the Parties.\n\n## Entire Agreement\n\nThis Agreement supersedes all prior understandings, representations, negotiations and correspondence between the student and the University of Massachusetts Lowell, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the matters described, and shall not be modified or affected by any course or dealing or course of performance.

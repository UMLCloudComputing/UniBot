These fall into two main categories: appeals and complaints. The process for each type of appeal or complaint is described below.\n\nStudent Appeals:\n\n- Registration and enrollment appeal\n- Medical withdrawal request\n- Academic suspension appeal\n- Financial aid and student academic progress (SAP) appeal\n- Academic integrity appeal\n- Student conduct and the judicial process\n- Course Grade Appeal Policy\u00a0(Grading Policies page)\n\nStudent Complaints:\n\n- Complaints about Courses or Instruction\u00a0- Students with concerns about a course should seek first to resolve problems by discussion with the faculty member. If this is not feasible, or if, after discussion between the student and professor, the matter is not resolved, the students may pursue additional avenues.\n- Non-Academic Complaints - Students with complaints about non-academic campus issues should contact The Solution Center. Complaints registered with the Solution Center will be forwarded to the appropriate department or office for response.\n- Reporting Concerns to Governing Bodies\u00a0- Students with a significant, systemic concern about UMass Lowell may also file a complaint with the New England Commission on Higher Education or with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Higher Education.\n- Online Student Complaints\u00a0- UMass Lowell is a member of The National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (NC-SARA), which, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Higher Education, aims to ensure quality in online education. Student complaints about matters relating to online education should proceed first through the campus processes above. If the issue is not resolved, students may address those complaints using the process described.\n\n## Student Appeals\n\nUMass Lowell\u2060is deeply committed to providing students with accurate and accessible information related to their experience at UMass Lowell both inside and outside the classroom. All academic policies and procedures are published in UMass Lowell\u2019sonline catalogand theStudent Conduct Code and Judicial Process. There are a number of appeal procedures in place to review issues that students may encounter.\n\nStudent Registration and Enrollment Appeals\u2060\n\nThe academic calendar clearly designates the add/drop period for each academic semester. There are no refunds after the add/drop period. Appeals related to registration/enrollment issues and requests for refunds due extenuating circumstances are reviewed by the Student Status Committee, comprised of representatives from the Registrar\u2019s Office, Student Financial Services, Financial Aid, Division of Graduate, Online & Professional Studies and designees of the Office of the Provost. A student who has experienced extenuating circumstances that prevented the student from dropping or withdrawing from a course or courses may appeal for consideration by submitting their request to the Student Status Committee. This request may be emailed to:Registrar@uml.edu, faxed to 978-934-4076, or mailed to Office of the Registrar, University Crossing, Suite M10, 220 Pawtucket St., Lowell, MA 01854-5129. Claims of extenuating circumstances must be supported by documentation.\n\nPlease review this information before submitting the appeal:\n\nMedical Withdrawal Request\u2060\n\nRequests related to medical issues should be made directly to the Student Health Services Office. Students shouldvisit the Medical Withdrawal site for details of the policy and process.\n\nAcademic Suspension Appeal\u2060\n\nAll students are required to maintain at least a 2.000 average throughout their academic career. Academic records are evaluated at the end of each semester. No student, however, will be academically suspended from the university without having at least one semester of academic warning. Some academic departments may have requirements specific to their academic program, however overall the minimum 2.0 academic standing is a university wide requirement. Students who are placed on academic suspension are sent a letter notifying them of their status which outlines the process for appeal for the college in which the student is enrolled. A suspended student may submit a written appeal to the College Dean or designee requesting permission to continue enrollment for an additional semester an academic probation. If permission to continue is granted, the program of study that must be undertaken and the minimum semester grade-point average that must be attained during the additional semester of academic warning will be made explicit. Detailed information on UMass Lowell\u2019s Academic Standing can be found in theacademic catalog.\n\nFinancial Aid and Student Academic Progress (SAP) Appeal\u2060\n\nStudents are required to make Satisfactory Academic Progress to maintain their eligibility for Financial Aid. The completeSatisfactory Academic Progress policy is available online. While this is process is related to a student's academic standing, it is a separate process from Academic Standing and students must submit their appeal directly to the Financial Aid Office.\n\nAcademic Integrity Appeal\u2060\n\nThe University of Massachusetts Lowell Academic Integrity policy and detailed appeal process may be found in theonline academic catalog.\n\nStudent Conduct and the Judicial Process\u2060\n\nStudents who wish to make an appeal related to student conduct or the judicial process should review the appeals process outlined in theUMass Lowell\u2019s Conduct Code.

If this is not feasible or if, after discussion between the student and professor, the matter cannot be resolved, the student has two options, listed below. Students are encouraged to pursue option (1) but if unsatisfied with the result of option (1), may pursue option (2):\n\nThe complaint must include the following elements:\n\n- (I) Student Name\n- (II) Student ID\n- (III) Class Section\n- (IV) Faculty Member\n- (V) Description of the Problem/Violation\n- (VI) Description of Attempt to Resolve Problem/Violation\n\nIf a formal complaint is filed, the faculty member who is the subject of the complaint will have the opportunity explain the situation to their appropriate superior (see below for more details of when and how the faculty member will discuss the issue with the Chairperson or Dean).\n\nIn all instances, a Chairperson or Dean must, in writing or by email, acknowledge receipt of the student\u2019s complaint as well as include a suggested remedy within four (4) academic calendar days of sending the complaint/filing a formal complaint.\n\nIf the student has not received a reply from the Chairperson within four (4) academic calendar days of sending the complaint/filing a formal complaint, then the student may communicate the complaint, in writing or by email, to the Dean of the College in which the alleged problem and/or violation is occurring.\n\nIf the student has not received a reply from the Dean within five (5) academic calendar days, then the student may communicate the complaint to the Office of the Provost in writing or by email.\n\nThe Chairperson or Dean will discuss the problem with the student and/or faculty member, and then determine whether the complaint is valid. Copies of the complaint, together with the written decision of the Chairperson or Dean, will be sent to the student, the faculty member, the Provost, and the President of the Massachusetts Society of Professors or the respective Faculty Union.\n\nFormal complaints about classroom problems shall be initiated before the last day of semester examinations. The determination of the Chairperson or Dean must be made within ten (10) working days following receipt of the student complaint and, if unchallenged by the MSP, is final. If the complaint is made towards the end of the semester, during finals week (for example, if the complaint is made on December 18, and the semester closes for winter break on December 19), the complaint is still valid and must be addressed. However, the student must receive a reply and an acknowledgement of receipt of the complaint within seven (7) business days and a final determination must be made in time for the student\u2019s grade to be adjusted, if authorized, or other action deemed appropriate to be executed.\n\nProfessors are encouraged to provide the above policy, or at least a link to the above policy, in their class syllabus.\n\n## Non-Academic Complaints\n\n## InstitutionalReporting Concerns to Governing Bodies\n\nStudents with concerns or complaints about If an issue cannot be resolved internally, the student may file a complaint about the University of Massachusetts Lowell with these organizations:\n\n- the Massachusetts Board of Higher Education\u00a0- The Board of Higher Education attempts to provide an avenue for the informal resolution of complaints and concerns regarding institutes of higher education.\n- UMass Lowell's accrediting agency, New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE)\u00a0- Students may contact the commission in writing with a complaint that raises significant questions about institutional conditions that violate the Standards of Accreditation.

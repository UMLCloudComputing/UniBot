    "text": "# Professional Co-Op FAQ | My Financial Aid | The Solution Center | UMass Lowell\n\n## Professional Co-Op FAQ\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n- Can I receive financial aid while I am out of school and participating in a professional co-op experience?\n- I need help with my living and transportation costs while on co-op. Can I get financial aid? What if I live on campus during my co-op experience?\n- What if I am planning on taking courses toward my degree while I am participating on co-op. Can I receive financial aid for these courses?\n- Do I have to notify financial aid that I am participating in a professional co-op and will I be able to receive financial aid when I return to school after my co-op experience?\n- I was told I will be considered a full time student while on co-op. Why can\u2019t I receive financial aid?\n- Will Going on Co-op Negatively Affect my Merit Scholarship?\n- Do I have to start repaying my student loans when I am participating in a professional co-op?\n- If I am participating in a professional co-op during the spring semester. Do I have to do anything special to regain financial aid for the next school year?\n- I need to take summer courses. Can I get financial aid?\n\nYou do not receive financial aid when you participate in a professional co-op as you are generally not enrolled in credits. Financial aid regulations require you to enroll in at least 6 credits per semester to be considered for financial aid.\n\nAs stated above, you need to be enrolled in at least 6 credits to receive financial aid. There are some private loan lenders what will allow you to borrow if you are enrolled in at least 1 credit during the time you are on professional co-op. Visit theAlternative Financing webpageto learn more.\n\nEven if you live on campus, you cannot receive financial aid if you are enrolled in less than 6 credits during the semester.\n\nIf you are taking at least 6 credits during the semester you are on a professional co-op, you may be eligible to receive a portion of your financial aid for these courses. You should contact the Solution Center to discuss what aid you would be eligible for as a part-time student.\n\nIt is not a requirement to meet with a financial aid staff member. It is always a good idea to contact them if you receive financial aid and to make sure you don\u2019t miss any deadlines while you are away. If you file for financial aid and meet the deadlines and all requirements, you will be eligible for financial aid when you return from your co-op experience. You can contact a Solution Center Specialist for more information.\n\nWhen you are on a professional co-op, your co-op coordinator will register you for the 0 credit, cooperative education course. This allows your co-op experience, with the name of your employing company, to appear on your academic transcript. It also allows UMass Lowell (UML) to report your status as \u201cfull time equivalent\u201d to the National Student Loan Clearinghouse and to your health insurance provider. If you borrowed Federal Direct student loans before participating in your co-op, this \u201cfull time equivalent\u201d status will prevent you from having to repay your Federal Direct student loans while on co-op. Maintaining your full-time status here at the University while on co-op, ensures the continuation of your medical coverage. To receive financial aid you must be enrolled in actual credits during the semester, see questions #1 and #2.\n\nNo, students who are on a professional co-op approved by the UMass Lowell (UML) Career Services and Co-op Center are eligible to resume their UML merit scholarship when they return from the co-op as long as they met the requirements for renewal before they left for co-op. Career Services informs the Financial Aid Office your co-op plans in order for the Financial Aid Office to properly reinstate your merit scholarship when you return. The semester on co-op does not count towards your maximum number of semesters you are eligible to receive your UML merit scholarship. (Exception: Immersive Scholars (UROC) Awards cannot be deferred, please refer to Immersive Scholars information packet). If you are unsure if the scholarship you have is considered a UML merit scholarship, email:scholarships@uml.edu.\n\nPrior to participating in a professional co-op experience, you should make sure that you have completed and submitted the co-op contract to your co-op coordinator. She/he will register you for the 0 credit co-op experience course. This allows your co-op experience to appear on your transcript. It also allows UML to report your status as \u201cfull time equivalent\u201d to the National Student Loan Clearinghouse. You will not enter into repayment on your Federal student loans (Direct and Perkins) as long as UML reports your status as \u201cfull time equivalent\u201d. If you get a notice to repay your federal student loans while on co-op, contact the Solution Center immediately for instructions. If you or your parents borrowed other private educational loans, please contact your lender for information on deferment options.\n\nYou will need to ensure you complete a new financial aid application (Free Application for Federal Student Aid - FAFSA) for the next academic year before you leave on co-op and definitely before the March 1st deadline. Even though you are on co-op, you are expected to meet the priority deadline. If you have questions,contact The Solution Center.\n\nIf you are interested in applying for merit scholarships, you should complete your scholarship general application in theRiverhawk Scholarship Portalbetween February 1 and March 31.\n\nFederal Pell Grant and Federal student loans may be available for you to use toward summer courses based on enrollment and financial need. If you have not exceeded your total annual limit during the fall/spring, you may be awarded the remainder for summer. To be reviewed for summer aid, you must complete the summer aid application available on the Solution Center website after March 1. You can also talk with a Solution Center Specialist to determine how much, if any, eligibility you have for summer aid.\n\nExample, Student A has eligibility for $5,500 in federal student loans for the full academic year. They received $2,750 for fall and then went out on co-op for the spring. For summer they could request the remaining $2,750 of their loan eligibility provided they are enrolled in at least 6 credits during the summer.\n\n"

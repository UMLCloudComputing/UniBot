The second part is intended to cover topics in an area of energy engineering of the student's interest, with the approval of the student's thesis advisor. The written part of this examination is closed book and composed of two sections, each of three hours duration. The examination is set and evaluated by the program Graduate Examination Committee, which determines whether or not a student shall be eligible to take the oral portion. Students who pass the written part of the qualifying examination must take the oral part of the examination within 6 weeks of notification of results of the written exam. The student is permitted two attempts at passing the qualifying examination which is administered on a declared schedule. Students who fail the qualifying examination the first time must retake the exam at its next scheduled offering. Students failing the doctoral exam twice will be automatically dismissed from the doctoral program.\n\nDissertation\n\nStudents may register for no more than six credit hours of research in preparing a formal dissertation proposal. This proposal, and the student's ability to perform the research, must be orally defended before the student's doctoral committee and other interested parties. The written proposal and oral defense constitute the candidacy examination. Upon passing this examination and completing all course requirements, the student becomes a candidate for the Ph.D. degree and may register for additional research credit with the adviser's approval.\n\nThe research work for the dissertation shall be conducted under the supervision of a program faculty advisor and a committee of two others, at least one of whom must be a faculty member in the university with the appropriate background for the thesis topic.\n\nFor Renewable Option Students:\n\nCombined QualifyingExamination and Dissertation Proposal\n\nThe Doctoral Qualifying Exam will consist of a written dissertation proposal (a document of typically 20 to 50 pages with appendices) and associated oral presentation by the examinee to an audience of peers and a committee of faculty members (minimum of three) where one of whom must be the examine's dissertation adviser. The committee may have in addition one of more members from outside UMass Lowell.\n\nAt least two weeks prior to the date of the presentation of the dissertation proposal, an announcement document must be submitted to the department graduate coordinator and to the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies in the College of Engineering by the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies.\n\nThe dissertation proposal is open to the public. The proposal will outline the motivation for the research, give a summary of the related past work in the area and present the scope of the proposed dissertation research. The presentation should be approximately 30 minutes. The proposal should clearly articulate the proposed contribution of the student to the knowledge base and how it differs from the past work. The examinee will be expected to answer questions from the audience that demonstrate his/her understanding of the proposed research, as well as demonstration his/her proficiency in the general research field related to the dissertation proposal.\n\nOther Requirements\n\n- The student must have a minimum grade point average of 3.250 in order to graduate.\n\n## Quick Links\n\n- Request Information\n- Apply\n- Check Application Status\n- Visit\n\n"

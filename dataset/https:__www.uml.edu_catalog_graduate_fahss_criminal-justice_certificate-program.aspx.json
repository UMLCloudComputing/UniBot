The existing degree programs in Criminal Justice, Community Social Psychology, and the College of Health Sciences each offer relevant courses that greatly assist their graduates working with agencies and clients affected by domestic violence. The certificate provides a focused program for those working in settings where domestic violence is an issue. Courses may be applied to the relevant department's Master's degree program with the approval of the department's graduate coordinator.\n\nRequired Courses(one of the 3-credit courses in each of the four groups):\n\nGroup 1:\n\n- CRIM.6310 Intimate Partner Violence (cross-listed as PSYC.6220\n- CRIM.6320 Responding to Child Abuse and Mistreatment\n\nGroup 2:\n\n- PUBH.6250 Health Policy\n- CRIM.5200 Administration of Criminal Justice\n- CRIM.6300 Victimology\n- PSYC.5040 The Family System\n\nGroup 3:\n\n- CRIM.5910 Research Design\n- CRIM.5950 Program Evaluation Methods\n- PSYC.5120 Applied Research Methods\n- PSYC.6110 Program Evaluation\n\nGroup 4:\n\n- PUBH.6160 Law and Ethics in Healthcare\n- PUBH.6250 Health Policy\n- CRIM.6520 Social Ecology of Crime\n- CRIM.6030 Gender, Race, and Crime\n- CRIM.6310 Intimate Partner Violence (cross-listed as PSYC.6220\n- CRIM.6320 Responding to Child Mistreatment\n- CRIM.6500 Violence in America\n- CRIM.6510 Criminal Homicide\n- CRIM.6550 Substance Abuse and Crime (cross-listed as PSYC.5310\n- PSYC.5000 Introduction to Community Social Psychology\n- PSYC.5230 Women in the Community\n- PSYC.5420 Working with Groups\n\n## Forensic-CriminologyGraduate Certificate in Forensic Criminology\n\nGraduate Coordinator:Amber Horning-Ruf, Ph.D.Email:Amber_Ruf@uml.eduPhone: 978-934-5391\n\nThe certificate is designed for students with current or potential careers in the fields of criminal justice, nursing/public health, law and paralegal studies, psychology, and social work who wish to expand their expertise in forensic criminology including mental health applications. Students in this program focus on populations being served by state and federal court systems, state and federal correctional systems, law enforcement agencies, mental health facilities, and juvenile facilities and are able to choose from a variety of courses appropriate for their own specific professional needs.\n\nRequired Courses:(Choose two of the following courses - 6 credits)\n\n- CRIM.5400 Criminal Profiling\n- CRIM.5410 Forensic Psychology\n- CRIM.6400 Criminal Mind and Criminal Behavior\n- CRIM.6410 Mental Health and Criminal Justice\n- CRIM.6500 Violence in America\n\nPlus two of the following(two 3-credit courses for a total of 6 credits):\n\n- CRIM.5010 Criminological Theory\n- CRIM.6510 Criminal Homicide\n- CRIM.6300 Victimology\n- CRIM.5710 Domestic Terrorism and Hate Crimes\n- CRIM.6550 Substance Abuse\n- CRIM.6310 Intimate Partner Violence\n- CRIM.6320 Responding to Child Mistreatment\n- CRIM.6420 Sex Crimes and Offenders\n\n## Leadership-&-Policy-DevelopmentGraduate Certificate in Leadership & Policy Development\n\nGraduate Coordinator:Amber Horning-Ruf, Ph.D.Email:Amber_Ruf@uml.eduPhone: 978-934-5391\n\nThe graduate certificate provides a focused program for criminal justice managers and administrators. This specialized education will increase the knowledge and skills necessary to administer delivery of high quality and cost effective services. This program is designed to respond to the changes taking place in the criminal justice field which require up-to-date management skills.\n\nRequired Courses(total of 6 credits):\n\n- CRIM.5210 Managing Criminal Justice Organizations\n- CRIM.6130 Law and Public Policy\n\nPlus two of the following(total of 6 credits):\n\n- CRIM.6520 Social Ecology of Crime\n- CRIM.5230 Issues in Policing\n- CRIM.5240 Issues in Corrections\n- CRIM.5260 Economic Crime\n- CRIM.5910 Research Design\n- CRIM.5950 Program Evaluation Methods\n- CRIM.6250 Seminar Juvenile Justice and Youth Crimes\n- CRIM.6260 Community Based Corrections\n- PSYC.5460 Grant Writing\n- POLI.5150 Politics and Economics of Public Policy\n\n## Security-StudiesGraduate Certificate in Security Studies\n\nGraduate Coordinator:James JF Forest, Ph.D.email:James_Forest@uml.eduPhone: 978-934-4773\n\nThis graduate-level certificate program addresses the increasing global and local concern involving security issues. The program consists of three required courses plus one elective course that can be chosen from a list of courses in the student's particular area of interest.\n\nAfter the tragedies of September 11, 2001, national policymakers called upon state and local law enforcement agencies to work together in strengthening our national defense. The formulation of the Homeland Security Act was a legislative effort to implement a \"total\" security infrastructure composed of federal, state, local, and private law enforcement agencies as well as a vast range of organizations that historically did not interface with one another.\n\nBecause of these recent changes in government, there is a growing need to understand the type of information gathering that occurs in these agencies, strategies for sharing the information while maintaining data quality, and ways to use the information for strategic planning, policy development and analysis. There are also concerns about how to go about gathering and analyzing this critical information without infringing upon the public's civil liberties and privacy rights.\n\nIn response to the demand for knowledge in this area, UMass Lowell's School of Criminology and Justice Studies has developed a graduate-level program designed to educate students in the complex nature of threats and how to manage them. Students can focus their studies in areas such as risk management and analysis; organizational and systems integration; legal and political policy and ethical issues in responding to threats; policy development and analysis; and the use of technology in implementing national security.\n\nIntended Audience\n\nThe program is appropriate for students with a general interest in homeland security, professionals who are currently employed in security-related jobs, and for those interested in pursuing careers in security.\n\nRequired Courses(9 credits):\n\n- CRIM.5780\u00a0Intelligence Analysis: Policy and Practice\n- CRIM.5750 Contemporary Security Studies\n- CRIM.6680\u00a0Scientific and Technical Dimensions of National Security\n\nPlus one of the following(3 credits):\n\n- CRIM.5700 Crisis and Emergency Management\n- CRIM.5710 Domestic Terrorism and Violent Extremism\n- CRIM.5720 Comparative Terrorism and Counterterrorism\n- CRIM.5730 Threat Assessment and Risk Management\n- CRIM.5740 Overview of Homeland Security\n- CRIM.5260 Economic Crime\n- CRIM.6940 Crime Analysis and Mapping\n- CRIM.5760 Criminal Justice Intelligence and Information Sharing\n- CRIM.6580 Issues in Computer Crime and Cyber Security\n- CRIM.6640\u00a0Weapons of Mass Destruction\n- CRIM.6660 Terrorist Networks\n\n## Victim-StudiesGraduate Certificate in Victim Studies\n\nGraduate Coordinator:Amber Horning-Ruf, Ph.D.Email:Amber_Ruf@uml.eduPhone: 978-934-5391\n\nThe Graduate Certificate in Victim Studies is a 12-credit program consisting of one required course (3 credits), one Victimization elective (3 credits), and two Skills and Knowledge electives (6 credits).\n\nThe purpose of the proposed Graduate Certificate in Victims\u2019 Studies is to provide multidisciplinary specialized knowledge of crime victim issues, crime victims\u2019 rights, and formal responses to victims so that students may apply that knowledge within their own professional context. Completion of the certificate will provide students with the background to understand strengths and limitations of current responses to crime victims so they can be a part of initiatives and programs to prevent crime victimization, be prepared to engage in research and evaluation focused on crime victims\u2019 issues, and respond effectively to victims of crime in a culturally appropriate manner.\n\nUnlike many graduate certificates which are designed to provide specialized knowledge within a particular field, the Graduate Certificate in Victims\u2019 Studies is designed to provide specialized knowledge on crime victims that can be applied in a broad range of fields. The courses offered draw from programs in Criminal Justice and Criminology, Education, Psychology, and Regional Economics and Social Development. All students will take a core overview course in Victimology, one course about a specific type of victimization, and two courses pertaining to skills, theory and/or evaluation.\n\nElective courses are organized in clusters according to skills and knowledge content. These options are intended to guide students as to how they can tailor their education to their particular interests and/or professional needs. For example, a program director in a human services agency might take Program Evaluation or Grant Writing.\n\nIn recent semesters, a number of graduate students enrolled in the Criminal Justice Masters and certificate programs, who are working in victim services, have expressed an interest in taking more courses in that field through UML. In addition, many of our students who have completed our Domestic Violence Prevention Certificate have expressed interest in further course work which addresses the diverse range of victims of other types of crimes, e.g. identify theft, economic crime, and cyber stalking. Therefore, the proposed certificate is distinct from the Domestic Violence Prevention Certificate and will focus on crime victims more broadly and also include victims of crimes committed by non-family members and strangers.\n\nTarget Audience\n\nThe target audience for the proposed certificate includes professionals or potential professionals in fields that come in direct contact with victims of crime, as well as those who simply seek to better understand victimization. Some of the professionals this would include are those who provide direct services to victims, those who supervise victim programs, and those who come in contact with victims as a part of their professional lives. Some examples include victim advocates, prosecutors, health services workers, law enforcement and corrections personnel, youth services workers, social workers, journalists, and first responders.\n\nRequired course:(3 credits)\n\n- CRIM.6300 Victimology\n\nElective Courses:\n\nVictimization Electives(choose one of the following 3 credit courses):\n\n- CRIM.5600 Gender, Race and Crime\n- CRIM.6310 Intimate Partner Violence\n- CRIM.6320 Responding to Child Mistreatment\n- PSYC.5090 Psychological Approaches to Child Maltreatment\n\nSkills and Knowledge Electives(Choose two of the following 3 credit courses):\n\nPlease note that clusters are suggested groupings based on student interest and their utility for application to current or potential employment.

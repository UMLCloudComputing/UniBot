Mid-term grades do not appear on transcripts. The grade is submitted by the faculty to inform the student of their current grade status.\n\nMidtermgradesMid-term grades are as follows:\n\n<table cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 100%;\"><tbody><tr><th align=\"left\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Abbreviation</th><th align=\"left\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Meaning</th></tr><tr><td><strong>CAU</strong></td><td>Caution</td></tr><tr><td><strong>FAI</strong></td><td>Failing</td></tr><tr><td><strong>NA</strong></td><td>Never Attended</td></tr><tr><td><strong>SAT</strong></td><td>Satisfactory</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n## Pass-No Credit Grading Scheme\n\ncStudents may elect to register on a pass-no credit basis for a maximum of four unrestricted elective courses. A student may not change grading scheme from letter grade to pass-no credit or from pass-no credit to letter grade after the established deadline for adding a course.\n\nA pass-no credit course cannot be presented in fulfillment of University Core Curriculum requirements, major programs, minor programs, or specifically designated courses (collateral requirements) of an established curriculum. A grade of P indicates that a student\u2019s performance merits an evaluation of C- or better. NC indicates that a course has been failed, but that such failure is without prejudice to the student\u2019s cumulative average. Although appropriate credits are granted to students when grades of P have been assigned, these credits are not qualitatively weighted and hence do not affect a student\u2019s academic average. The entry NC will not keep an otherwise qualified student from dean\u2019s list recognition.\u00a0Students must request pass-no credit grading scheme for each course by the last date to add/drop.\n\n## Satisfactory-Unsatisfactory Course Registration\n\ndCertain courses (e.g., practicum experiences, advanced seminars, and directed studies) may be graded as satisfactory or unsatisfactory. A grade of S indicates that a student\u2019s performance merits an evaluation of C or better. U indicates a course evaluation of less than C. Although appropriate credits are granted to students when grades of S have been assigned, these credits are not qualitatively weighted and hence do not affect a student\u2019s academic average. A grade of U indicates that attempted course credits have not been granted and is awarded without prejudice to a student\u2019s cumulative average.\n\n## Incomplete Courses\n\neThe symbol INC (incomplete) is a temporary notation that is assigned for incomplete work in courses when a student\u2019s performance justifies the expectation that they will obtain a passing grade upon completion, but the student has not completed a course requirement, such as a final exam or final project, for emergency reasons.\n\nEligibility for a grade of INC\n\nThe grade of INC may be considered only for students who have consistently attended class and completed assignments throughout the course. Further, students receiving an INC must have been present in class regularly through the first 60% of the course.\n\nA student who has evidenced an unsatisfactory course record, who has not attended class regularly through the first 60% of the course, who has failed to complete a major portion of an instructor\u2019s course requirements, or who fails to provide an instructor with a satisfactory reason for absence from a final examination or final course evaluation within the required period may not be assigned the letter symbol INC.\n\nProcess\n\nA student has a 48-hour period from the time of the missed final exam or project due date to provide an acceptable explanation for their non-completion. If the student is not eligible for an INC either on the basis of the terms above or because they did not provide a satisfactory explanation in the required time frame, the faculty should calculate the grade according to the syllabus and submit the roster by the Registrar\u2019s due date.\n\nResponsibility for making arrangements with an instructor to complete all outstanding course work rests entirely with the student, who must complete all course work by the final week of classes in the following semester.\n\nAt the end of the official make-up period (or, in the event of a substantiated student emergency, at the end of an extended make-up period), the Office of the Registrar will convert the temporary notation of INC to the appropriate permanent symbol. This permanent notation will be one of the following:\n\nLimited extensions of the make-up period may be granted to a student for serious medical reasons and for documented personal emergencies. Requests for such extensions are approved by the dean of the college in which student is enrolled as a degree candidate, and must be filed no later than one calendar week preceding the established deadline for instructors to submit final grades for incomplete courses.\n\n## Audited Courses\n\nfA student may enroll in credit courses as an auditor with appropriate approval. Forms and instructions for registration as an auditor may be obtained from the Office of the Registrar. No charge is levied on full-time \u201ctraditional day\u201d students for audited courses. Auditing courses through the division of Graduate and Professional Studies will incur additional tuition and fees. No credit or grade will be recorded for an audited course, but the symbol AU will be listed on the permanent record. A change from audit to credit status, or from credit status to audit, may not be made after the deadline for adding a course (10th class day).\n\nStudents who have audited a course subsequently may not earn credit by repeating the same course, or through tests of the College Level Examination Program or through other authorized examination procedures for course challenge.\n\n## Grade Changes\n\ngAt the end of each semester, grades are available to students via their self service account in SIS. All course grades become a part of the student\u2019s official record upon instructor assignment and may not be changed except as specifically provided by University procedures. Corrections of grade-point averages automatically are authorized when grade reports are corrected by instructors and when specific courses are deleted from grade-point averages under provisions of University regulations governing repeated courses and course deletions.\n\nChanges of grades other than the filing of grades for incomplete courses require the endorsement of the appropriate college dean. Grade changes may not be made on a student\u2019s permanent record after the deadlines cited in the academic calendar unless such changes have been authorized by appropriate college deans.\n\n## Course Grade Appeal Policy\n\nhThe instructor of the class is the primary authority with respect to a student\u2019s proficiency and final grade in that course. A student who believes that his or her final grade reflects an erroneous, capricious, arbitrary, or prejudiced academic evaluation may appeal the grade. The academic judgment used in determining the merits of the grade to be awarded shall not be reviewable. This process does not apply to cases of academic dishonesty, which are adjudicated through the \u201cacademic dishonesty process.\u201d\n\n- (a) that the appeal be dismissed;\n- (b) if there is demonstrable evidence of an erroneous, arbitrary, capricious, or prejudiced academic evaluation, then the chairperson will recommend appropriate remedies that a grade be changed or the student be allowed an opportunity to retake an examination or other exercise; or\n- (c) that another appropriate remedy be administered.\n\n- (a) that the appeal be dismissed;\n- (b) if the student provides demonstrable evidence of an erroneous, arbitrary, capricious, or prejudiced academic evaluation, then the Dean will recommend appropriate remedies that a grade be changed or the student be allowed an opportunity to retake an examination or other exercise; or\n- (c) that another appropriate remedy be administered.\n\n## Quick Links\n\n- Request Information\n- Apply\n- Check Application Status\n- Visit\n\n"
